11:T3393,# What Is Devekut in Breslov? The Advanced Guide to Cleaving to God

## Beyond Observance: The Call to Devekut

Most discussions of Jewish religious life focus on *halakha* — the law. Do this. Avoid that. Pray these words at these times. Eat this, not that. The halakhic framework is real, binding, and sacred.

But Rabbi Nachman of Breslov, like all the great masters of Hasidism, insists that halakhic compliance alone — while necessary — is not the ultimate destination. The destination is *devekut*: the state of cleaving to God, the continuous attachment of the human soul to its divine source, the love-union that the Torah describes in Deuteronomy 11:22 — "*v'davkah bo*" — and to cleave to Him.

This guide is an advanced exploration of devekut in Breslov: what it is metaphysically, how it differs from adjacent concepts, what the specific Breslov practices are for cultivating it, what the obstacles are, and what the lived experience of devekut actually feels like according to those who have described it.

## Defining Devekut: Attachment, Cleaving, Union

The Hebrew root *dalet-vav-kaf* (דבק) means to cleave, to cling, to adhere. Devekut is the noun form: the state of cleaving. It appears in Torah in three contexts:

1. A man cleaving to his wife (Genesis 2:24) — *vdavak b'ishto*
2. Israel cleaving to God (Deuteronomy 10:20) — *uvo tidbak*
3. The soul cleaving to God as the very nature of love of God

Rabbi Nachman understands devekut not as an occasional spiritual high or a meditative state achieved in retreat but as the *constant background* of the properly oriented spiritual life. The person of devekut does not experience God as available only during prayer — they experience the divine presence as the field within which all activity occurs.

The classic formulation from *Shiviti HaShem l'negdi tamid* (Psalm 16:8): "I have placed the Lord before me constantly." This is not an aspiration for exceptional moments. It is the ordinary spiritual posture of the person who has cultivated devekut.

## Devekut vs. Adjacent Concepts: Clarifying the Map

Devekut is frequently confused with three adjacent spiritual concepts. Understanding the distinctions clarifies what devekut actually is:

### Devekut vs. Bitachon (Trust)

*Bitachon* — trust in God — is a cognitive-emotional disposition: the conviction that God is managing reality for the good and that the soul need not be consumed by anxiety. Bitachon is about the structure of one's relationship to uncertainty.

Devekut is a different register: not about trust specifically but about continuous presence. A person can have bitachon without devekut (they trust God but are not in continuous conscious contact with God). The ideal is both: trust expressed through presence.

### Devekut vs. Awe (*Yirat Shamayim*)

*Yirat Shamayim* (fear of Heaven) is the foundational orientation of Jewish religious life — the recognition that God is real, that actions matter, that consequences exist. Awe is the appropriate response to genuine power.

Devekut transcends awe toward love. The Breslov masters, following the general Hasidic tradition, emphasize that while awe is the foundation, love is the completion. You cannot truly cleave to something you only fear. Devekut requires *ahavah* (love) — the attraction of the soul toward its source, the desire to be in continuous contact with the beloved.

### Devekut vs. Prayer

Prayer (*tefillah*) is the scheduled, formal engagement with the divine — three times daily, with prescribed words. Devekut is the continuous substrate from which prayer emerges and to which it returns.

Rabbi Nachman's highest description of hitbodedut (personal prayer) is that it is the door to devekut. The person who prays with full attention and genuine desire uses prayer as a vehicle for entering the state of cleaving — and then ideally carries that state beyond the formal prayer time into the ordinary day.

## The Breslov Path to Devekut: Five Practices

### Practice One: Shiviti — The Placement of the Divine Name

The oldest Hasidic practice for cultivating devekut is *Shiviti* — the intentional placement of the four-letter divine name (*YHVH*) in the field of consciousness. The name is written on a plaque and placed at eye level during prayer; but more importantly, it is kept in awareness as a continuous mental focus.

Rabbi Nachman refines this practice: the divine name is not a magic formula but the pointer to a reality. What Shiviti cultivates is the habit of noticing — regularly during the day, in the midst of activity — that the divine reality is the context within which all action occurs. The person who stops briefly ten times a day to internally acknowledge "*HaShem is here*" is practicing Shiviti in its living form.

### Practice Two: Hitbodedut as Devekut Training

The hourly practice of *hitbodedut* — Rabbi Nachman's signature practice of personal, spontaneous verbal prayer in privacy — is the primary tool for developing the capacity for devekut.

The mechanism: in hitbodedut, the person speaks to God directly, in their own words, about their actual inner life. Over time, this practice creates a deep familiarity with the experience of speaking to God — making it easier to maintain this relationship outside the formal hitbodedut session.

The advanced stage of hitbodedut is precisely devekut: the transition from "I am now doing hitbodedut" to "the conversation with God is the background of my day." Rabbi Nathan describes Rabbi Nachman's own consciousness in this way — the Rebbe lived in a constant internal conversation with God that never interrupted his external life.

### Practice Three: Torah Learning as Cleaving

Rabbi Nachman teaches (*Likutey Moharan* I:101) that the Torah is the *lashon* (language) of God — not merely a text but a continuous expression of divine consciousness. When a person learns Torah with the intention of connecting to the divine intelligence embedded in it, the learning itself becomes a form of devekut.

The practical distinction: Torah learned as *information* builds knowledge. Torah learned as *connection* builds devekut. The difference is not in the text studied but in the inner orientation: *"I am not merely learning about what God said. I am speaking with God through what God said."*

This orientation transforms even basic halakhic study — the laws of Shabbat, the order of prayers — from information about God's will to encounter with God's will.

### Practice Four: Breslov Niggun — Music as Direct Connection

Rabbi Nachman famously composed and transmitted melodies — *niggunim* — that he described as capable of opening the soul's connection to its divine source. The most famous is the *Tikkun HaKlali* melody; others are transmitted through generations of Breslov practitioners.

The mechanism of niggun as devekut tool: music bypasses the analytical mind and reaches directly into the *neshamah* (divine soul). The analytic mind can interrupt devekut by raising objections, distractions, and doubts. Music reaches beneath the analytic layer, creating states of soul-opening that can be the entry point to cleaving.

Rabbi Nachman instructs: when you find yourself spiritually blocked — unable to pray, unable to feel the divine presence, caught in the distractions of *katnut* (diminished consciousness) — sing. A *niggun*, even without words, can break the spiritual block and restore the devekut connection.

### Practice Five: Devekut Through the Tzaddik

The distinctively Breslov approach to devekut involves the mediating role of the *tzaddik*. Rabbi Nachman teaches that the soul of an ordinary person, clouded by the accumulated confusion of unprocessed sin and spiritual distraction, cannot always make direct contact with the divine.

The tzaddik — whose soul has been refined to a high degree of transparency — can serve as a spiritual antenna: the person who cleaves to the tzaddik receives, through the tzaddik, the divine illumination that they could not access directly.

This teaching has been controversial — it can sound like it places an intermediary between the soul and God. Rabbi Nachman's clarification: the tzaddik is not a replacement for God-consciousness but a facilitator of it. Just as a spiritual teacher can open concepts that a student cannot reach alone, the tzaddik can open dimensions of divine presence that the student's unrefined soul cannot access alone. The goal remains direct devekut; the tzaddik is the guide, not the destination.

## The Obstacles to Devekut

### Hirhurim: Intrusive Thoughts

The primary obstacle to devekut in Breslov's analysis is *hirhurim* — the stream of intrusive thoughts that continuously disrupts consciousness. These range from mundane distraction (thinking about dinner during prayer) to spiritually dangerous thoughts (doubts about God, sexual fantasy, resentments).

Rabbi Nachman teaches explicitly: do not fight hirhurim directly. The mind that tries to suppress an intrusive thought by force typically strengthens it. Instead: notice the thought without engaging it, return attention to the divine presence, and let the thought pass without narrative elaboration.

The advanced Breslov teaching: even hirhurim can become devekut-tools. The *Baal Shem Tov* (Rabbi Israel ben Eliezer, the founder of Hasidism and Rabbi Nachman's great-grandfather) teaches that a disturbing thought that arises during prayer may be presenting something that needs to be elevated — brought to God rather than suppressed. The devekut practitioner learns to receive even the problematic thoughts as material for conversation with God.

### Spiritual Aridity: Katnut

Every person who seriously cultivates devekut will pass through periods of *katnut* (smallness) — times when the divine presence seems entirely absent, prayer feels mechanical, and cleaving seems impossible.

Rabbi Nachman's instruction for these periods: maintain the practice even without the feeling. The person who prays in katnut without feeling God's presence is performing an act of extraordinary faith — precisely because there is no reward of spiritual feeling in the moment.

The Breslov teaching is explicit: **the value of devekut that happens in katnut is greater than the value of devekut in gadlut (expanded consciousness)**, because it demonstrates that the connection is based on commitment rather than spiritual pleasure. The person who only cleaves when they feel good does not truly cleave.

### The Pride Trap

A subtle but dangerous obstacle to devekut is what Rabbi Nachman calls *ga'avah* (pride) in spiritual achievement. The person who becomes attached to the experience of devekut — who begins to think of themselves as spiritually advanced — has replaced devekut with its counterfeit.

Genuine devekut is characterized by *anavah* (humility) — the ongoing recognition that the connection to God is entirely God's gift, not the practitioner's achievement. The more genuinely someone has developed devekut, the more they experience their own inadequacy relative to the divine enormity they are touching.

## The Lived Experience of Devekut: What the Breslov Masters Describe

What does devekut actually feel like? The Breslov masters describe it in several ways:

- **As *hishlabshut* (enclothing):** The divine presence wraps around the soul like a garment, not as an external relationship but as an interior experience of being held.

- **As *bittul* (self-nullification):** The ordinary self-concern, the constant internal monologue of needs and fears and plans, temporarily stills. Not because the self is destroyed but because something more real than the self is present.

- **As heightened clarity:** Decisions that were unclear become clear. Questions about what to do or say resolve because the connection to the divine intelligence that knows already becomes active.

- **As warmth:** The *Or HaGanuz* — the hidden light that Kabbalah describes as the original divine light stored for the righteous — is sometimes described as felt physically as warmth in the chest during genuine devekut.

## Devekut and the Nova Key

The NFC Nova Key embodies the Breslov teaching on devekut in a specific way: the physical object — made of metal, tangible and real — encodes access to the Ten Psalms of Tikkun HaKlali, which Rabbi Nachman described as the vehicle for the *tikunim* (rectifications) that remove the obstacles to devekut.

The key is not a magical object. It is a *remez* (hint) — a physical pointer to the spiritual reality it encodes. The person who uses the Nova Key to access the Tikkun HaKlali and recites the psalms with genuine intention is practicing devekut through the chain: physical object → digital portal → sacred text → divine presence.

*Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman.*

The four syllables of the Na Nach phrase are themselves a devekut formula — a four-step progressive drawing-close of the soul to its divine source, encoded in the progression of a single divine name.
