11:T2b9b,# Breslov Prayer for Fertility and Pregnancy: A Complete Guide to Rabbi Nachman's Teachings

## The Sacred Longing: Breslov on Childlessness and the Desire to Create Life

In the biblical and Jewish mystical tradition, no desire is considered more foundational than the desire to bring life into the world. The very first commandment given to humanity — *peru ur'vu*, be fruitful and multiply — is not merely a legal obligation in Jewish law. It is an expression of the human being's deepest participation in divine creative energy.

For the couple struggling with infertility, or the woman hoping and praying through each difficult month, the longing for a child is not a peripheral spiritual concern. It is a wound at the center of their identity and their prayer life.

Rabbi Nachman of Breslov's teachings on prayer, on the creative power of speech, and on the specific spiritual dynamics of *pru ur'vu* (reproduction) form a coherent and deeply comforting framework for those walking the path of fertility and pregnancy. While Rabbi Nachman is not a fertility doctor — and his teachings do not replace medical evaluation and care — what he offers is something medicine alone cannot provide: a framework for the spiritual dimensions of this journey, and a practice of prayer that has sustained Jewish couples through this particular darkness for over two centuries.

## The Mothers of Israel: Breslov's Teaching on Barrenness as Spiritual Passage

Rabbi Nachman drew deeply on the narrative of the *Imahot* — the Matriarchs — as a spiritual template. Three of the four Matriarchs experienced extended periods of barrenness: Sarah, Rebecca, and Rachel. These are not incidental biographical details. In the Breslov reading, they are the Torah's encoded teaching about the relationship between intense longing and eventual spiritual breakthrough.

Rabbi Nachman teaches that the prayer born from unfulfilled longing carries a unique spiritual weight. The Talmud (Yevamot 64a) states: "Why were the Matriarchs barren? Because God desires the prayers of the righteous." This is not a comfortable teaching — it can feel as though God is withholding something precious to extract prayer. But the Breslov reading is more nuanced: the barrenness creates the depth of longing that produces the prayer of total surrender, which is itself the deepest form of connection with the divine.

This does not mean barrenness is good. It means that the suffering of unfulfilled longing, channeled through prayer rather than bitterness, can become a vehicle for spiritual transformation of a kind that does not come any other way.

## Hitbodedut for Fertility: What to Actually Say

Rabbi Nachman's practice of *hitbodedut* — private, personal, verbal prayer in your own language — is perhaps his most concrete gift to those hoping for a child.

The specific hitbodedut for fertility is not a formula. Rabbi Nachman was explicit that formal prayer formulas are a foundation, not a ceiling. The highest prayer is the one that uses your own words to speak your own truth.

**What to include**:

**The direct request**: Speak plainly. "I want a child. I want to feel a baby growing inside me. I want to hold my child. Please." Rabbi Nachman teaches that God wants our precise requests, not our vague spiritual generalities.

**The fear**: "I am afraid that it won't happen. I am afraid that we will go through another year of this. I am afraid that there is something broken in me." Speak the fear explicitly. Naming it breaks its power.

**Gratitude for what already is**: The practice of *hakarat hatov* (recognizing the good) is especially important in fertility struggle, because the pain of what is absent can eclipse gratitude for what is present. Speak explicitly about your partner, your home, your health, whatever genuine goods exist in your life.

**Surrender**: "Whatever is Your will, help me to bear it. And if it is Your will that we have this child, please bring it to us." This is not resignation — it is the deepest form of trust.

**Timing**: Rabbi Nachman prescribes *chatzot* (midnight) for the most intense personal prayers, particularly *Tikkun Chatzot* — the midnight lamentation over spiritual exile and personal lack. For couples navigating fertility, a short midnight prayer together or separately can be extraordinarily powerful.

## The Tikkun HaKlali and Fertility

Rabbi Nachman prescribed ten specific psalms — collectively known as the *Tikkun HaKlali* — as a comprehensive spiritual repair for what he described as the spiritual damage associated with *keri* (sexual energy improperly directed). The ten psalms are: 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150.

In Breslov tradition, the Tikkun HaKlali is specifically relevant to fertility for two reasons:

1. **Spiritual repair**: Rabbi Nachman taught that proper channeling of sexual energy — its consecration within marriage, its orientation toward life-creation — generates spiritual power. The Tikkun HaKlali is a mechanism for repairing whatever spiritual damage may have accumulated in this domain.

2. **Openness to blessing**: Rabbi Nachman's promise regarding the Tikkun HaKlali includes the concept that its recitation opens *sha'arei bracha* — gates of blessing — that were previously closed. For couples seeking pregnancy, this is traditionally understood to include the blessing of children.

**Practical guidance**: Recite the ten psalms together as a couple, or individually, with specific intention for pregnancy and healthy birth. Many Breslov teachers recommend doing this after immersion in the *mikveh* (ritual bath).

## The Mikveh: Breslov on the Spiritual Dimensions of Taharat HaMishpacha

Rabbi Nachman's teachings on *taharat hamishpacha* (family purity laws) go beyond the legal requirements. He connects the spiritual state of *taharah* (ritual purity) to receptivity for divine blessing.

The monthly immersion in the mikveh is, in the Breslov reading, not merely a physical cleansing. It is a renewal of spiritual receptivity — the creation of a vessel that is open to receive. Rabbi Nachman teaches that the night of a wife's immersion carries special spiritual potential for conception, not only biologically but spiritually.

For couples trying to conceive, the Breslov tradition recommends:

- **Hitbodedut before mikveh immersion** — the wife speaks to God specifically about her hope for pregnancy before immersing.
- **The husband recites Tikkun HaKlali** on the night of immersion.
- **Both partners approach the union** with specific intention (*kavvanah*) for creating life, not merely for physical connection.

This is the *mitzvah* of onah elevated to a spiritual practice.

## Rabbi Nachman's Promise Regarding the Children of Those Who Come to Uman

Among the most specific of Rabbi Nachman's recorded promises is one that directly addresses fertility. He said:

> "Whoever comes to me at Rosh Hashanah and gives a penny to charity — I will do my utmost on their behalf. I will watch over them in this world and in the next. Even if a person has spent their years in terrible sins... I will pull them out from Gehinnom by their payot."

In Breslov tradition, this promise has been applied specifically to the matter of children: families who made the pilgrimage to Uman and prayed at Rabbi Nachman's grave have a remarkable testimonial literature about subsequent pregnancies after years of barrenness. These accounts are not medical evidence. They are the lived spiritual testimony of a community that has prayed at this grave for over two centuries.

Whether or not one makes the pilgrimage, the tradition of directing prayers specifically to Rabbi Nachman's intercession — asking him to advocate before the divine throne for the blessing of children — is widely practiced in the Breslov world and beyond.

## The Psalms Most Associated With Fertility in Breslov Practice

Beyond the Tikkun HaKlali, several psalms are specifically recommended in Breslov tradition for those praying for children:

**Psalm 128**: "Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine within your home; your children like olive plants around your table." This psalm is specifically associated with the blessing of children and is traditionally recited at the Shabbat table.

**Psalm 113**: Contains the verse "He makes the barren woman dwell in her house as the joyful mother of children." Recited with specific intention for fertility.

**Psalm 20**: "May God answer you on the day of distress" — for the days of waiting and anxiety.

**Psalm 22**: "They cried to You and were saved; they trusted in You and were not put to shame" — for the days when trust is hard to maintain.

## Breslov on Pregnancy: Guarding the Sacred Space

For the woman who has become pregnant after a period of seeking, or who is pregnant and carrying the weight of anxiety about the outcome, Rabbi Nachman's teachings on *shmirat habrit* (guarding the covenant) and spiritual protection during pregnancy are particularly relevant.

Rabbi Nachman taught that the world a child enters is shaped in part by the spiritual environment surrounding the pregnancy. Specifically:

**Joy is protective**. The Breslov teaching that *mitzvah gedolah lihyot besimcha tamid* (it is a great mitzvah to always be in joy) applies with special force during pregnancy. The mother's emotional state — her joy, her trust, her peace — flows into the developing child's *nefesh* (soul).

**Guard the speech environment**. Harsh speech, arguments, exposure to cruelty — all of these are spiritually damaging during pregnancy in the Breslov teaching. This is not a superstition. It reflects the understanding that the growing soul is particularly permeable to the spiritual quality of its environment.

**Daily Modeh Ani and specific prayers for the child's health** — naming what you are praying for by name, speaking to God about this specific child, this specific pregnancy, this specific hope — is the core of Breslov pregnancy practice.

## When the Answer Is Not Yes: Breslov on Pregnancy Loss and Continuing Hope

Perhaps the most difficult moment in the fertility and pregnancy journey is loss: miscarriage, stillbirth, failed IVF cycles, the month's period arriving after a month of hope.

Rabbi Nachman has one teaching for these moments above all others: *Ein ye'ush ba'olam klal*. There is no such thing as despair in the world. This chapter is not the last chapter. This loss is not the final word.

He pairs this with the teaching on *techiyat ha'nefesh* — the resurrection of the soul within life. A person can be spiritually and emotionally dead, numb with grief, unable to pray, unable to speak — and then, in a moment of genuine encounter with God or with community, come alive again.

For pregnancy loss specifically: speak the grief in hitbodedut. Name the child you lost. Mourn fully. Do not rush past the mourning. And then — in your own time, when the mourning has been honored — return to the practice of hope.

*Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman.*

The living God who created the first children is still creating children today. Turn to Him.
