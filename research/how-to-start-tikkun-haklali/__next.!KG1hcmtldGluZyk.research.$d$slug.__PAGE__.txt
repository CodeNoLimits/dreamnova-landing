3:T2b04,# How to Start the Tikkun HaKlali: A Complete Beginner's Guide

## What Is the Tikkun HaKlali?

The *Tikkun HaKlali* — Hebrew for "The Complete Remedy" or "The General Repair" — is a collection of ten specific psalms identified by Rabbi Nachman of Breslov as a comprehensive spiritual repair (*tikkun*) for the soul.

Rabbi Nachman made an extraordinary declaration about these ten psalms: reciting them with sincere intention is a *tikkun klali* — a complete, global repair — addressing the full spectrum of spiritual damage that can accumulate in a person's life, particularly in the area of sexuality and creative energy. He stated this so emphatically that his primary disciple, Reb Noson (Rabbi Natan of Breslov), recorded him saying: "I can assert this with absolute certainty."

The ten psalms, in order, are:
**16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150**

These are not the ten most famous psalms, nor the ten longest. Rabbi Nachman identified them through a specific Kabbalistic process related to the *tikkun* of *pegam habrit* (the blemish of the covenant) — the spiritual damage associated with the improper use of sexual and creative energy. The full Kabbalistic reasoning is recorded in *Likutey Moharan* and the writings of Reb Noson.

## Why These Ten Psalms?

Rabbi Nachman's selection of these ten psalms is based on a correspondence between specific psalms and specific aspects of spiritual repair that Kabbalists had identified before him, which he then organized into a coherent complete unit.

The *gematria* (numerical value) of the word *tikkun* (תיקון = 566) and specific mystical correspondences connect these psalms to the repair of all ten categories of spiritual damage that Breslov Kabbalah identifies. The full explanation is beyond this guide — what matters practically is that the ten psalms together form a complete unit, and that reciting them as a complete unit carries an effect that reciting them individually does not.

**Important**: Rabbi Nachman's promise is specifically attached to reciting all ten psalms together. Reciting three of them, or five, or eight, is not the Tikkun HaKlali. It must be all ten, in sequence.

## The Promise: What Rabbi Nachman Said

Rabbi Nachman's declaration about the Tikkun HaKlali is recorded in *Sichot HaRan* (Conversations of Reb Noson) and is perhaps his most specific promise:

> "Know that the Tikkun HaKlali is a very great thing. Whoever recites these ten psalms — and gives even a small amount of charity [in conjunction] — I am very certain that there will be a tikkun, a complete and comprehensive repair of what was blemished..."

He further stated:

> "I know these ten psalms by a true and certain path. Whoever believes me and recites these ten psalms on that day when he stumbles... I will stand at the head of the world to come (the gates of heaven) and pull them out, even from the lowest depths."

This promise is specifically directed at people who have stumbled — who have fallen spiritually, who feel beyond help, who carry shame about sexual or other failures. It is not addressed to the already-pure; it is addressed to the broken.

## The Basic Practice: Step by Step

### What You Need

**A book of Psalms (Tehillim)** — with or without translation, depending on your Hebrew level. There are excellent editions with English facing pages. The Artscroll *Tehillim* is widely used. Any edition works.

**A small amount of charity (*tzedaka*)** — Rabbi Nachman associates the Tikkun HaKlali with giving charity, even a minimal amount. A few coins given to charity, or a small donation made before or after recitation, activates this dimension of the practice.

**Privacy, ideally** — though not required. The Tikkun HaKlali can be recited anywhere, but a private space allows for more focused intention.

**Ten to twenty minutes** — at a comfortable pace, the ten psalms take approximately ten to fifteen minutes to read. In Hebrew with proper pronunciation, closer to fifteen. With English, twenty.

### The Sequence

Recite the following psalms in order:

1. **Psalm 16** (*Michtam L'David*) — "Preserve me, O God, for in You I have taken refuge"
2. **Psalm 32** (*L'David Maskil*) — "Happy is he whose transgression is forgiven"
3. **Psalm 41** (*LaMenatzei'ach Mizmor L'David*) — "Happy is he who considers the poor"
4. **Psalm 42** (*LaMenatzei'ach Maskil Livnei Korach*) — "As a hart yearns for water brooks"
5. **Psalm 59** (*LaMenatzei'ach Al Tashheth L'David Michtam*) — "Save me from my enemies, my God"
6. **Psalm 77** (*LaMenatzei'ach Al Yedutun L'Asaf*) — "I will cry out to God with my voice"
7. **Psalm 90** (*Tefila L'Moshe*) — "A Prayer of Moses" — "O Lord, You have been our dwelling place"
8. **Psalm 105** (*Hodu LaHashem*) — "Give thanks to the Lord, call upon His name"
9. **Psalm 137** (*Al Naharot Bavel*) — "By the rivers of Babylon"
10. **Psalm 150** (*Halleluya Hallelu El*) — "Hallelujah, praise God in His sanctuary"

After completing all ten, give charity — even a few coins.

### Hebrew or Translation?

Rabbi Nachman gave the Tikkun HaKlali to the Jewish people without language qualification. The tradition is to recite in Hebrew when possible, as the Hebrew text carries specific Kabbalistic resonance.

However: reciting in English with full understanding and intention is preferred over reciting in Hebrew mechanically without comprehension. For those building their Hebrew, the dual-language approach — following the English while reading the Hebrew — is excellent.

The Tikkun HaKlali App (available for iOS and Android) includes the text in Hebrew, transliteration, and English, with the psalms in correct order. This is an accessible starting point.

## When to Recite the Tikkun HaKlali

### The Standard Practice

The traditional Breslov practice is to recite the Tikkun HaKlali:

- **Once a month at minimum** — as a general spiritual maintenance practice
- **After experiencing a nocturnal emission (*keri*)** — Rabbi Nachman's original prescription was specifically for this; recite within 24 hours
- **After any significant spiritual stumbling** — whatever form that takes for you, whenever you feel spiritually distant or polluted
- **During Shovavim** — the six-week period of spiritual repair (roughly January-February) when many recite it daily

### For More Advanced Practice

Many Breslov men recite the Tikkun HaKlali daily — often after morning prayers. This is the practice of the more committed Breslov practitioner. If you are beginning, monthly is the correct starting point.

### Ideal Timing

Rabbi Nachman associated the Tikkun HaKlali specifically with:
- **After immersion in the *mikveh*** — the ritual bath
- **On the day of stumbling**, not the next week
- **After nighttime awakening** — some practitioners recite it after waking in the night, particularly if the night included difficult experiences

## Before You Begin: Setting Intention (*Kavvanah*)

The Tikkun HaKlali is most effective when recited with *kavvanah* — directed intention. This does not require elaborate preparation. Before beginning:

**Spend thirty seconds in silence** — gather your attention from wherever it is scattered.

**Name your intention** — either silently or in a whisper: "I am reciting these ten psalms for the repair (*tikkun*) of my soul and for the elevation of whatever spiritual damage I have caused, in this area and all areas. I recite these in the merit of Rabbi Nachman ben Simcha and with trust in his promise."

**Hold your specific situation in mind** — whether you are reciting after a specific failure, for general maintenance, for a particular person's healing, or for any other intention.

You do not need to feel spiritual to begin. You do not need to be in a good emotional state. Rabbi Nachman's promise is specifically addressed to people who are in poor spiritual states. The practice works from wherever you are.

## Common Mistakes and Questions

### "I Don't Know Hebrew. Can I Still Do This?"

Yes. See above — English translation carries full intention. Starting with transliteration while learning the Hebrew is excellent practice.

### "I Missed a Week / Month. Do I Start Over?"

There is no starting over — the Tikkun HaKlali is not a streak. Each recitation stands alone. If you haven't recited it in three months, recite it today. That's all.

### "Do I Need to Be Orthodox to Do This?"

No. Rabbi Nachman addressed his teachings to all Jews, including those far from observance. The Tikkun HaKlali requires no level of religious observance to be valid. Recite it as you are.

### "Can Women Recite the Tikkun HaKlali?"

Rabbi Nachman's original prescription was specifically related to male sexual physiology. However, many poskim (halakhic authorities) in the Breslov tradition hold that women can and should recite the Tikkun HaKlali as a general spiritual repair practice. Many Breslov women do.

### "What If I Fall Asleep Partway Through?"

Complete it when you wake up. The ten psalms should ideally be recited in one sitting, but if you fall asleep, continuing upon waking is acceptable.

### "I Feel Nothing When I Recite It"

This is normal, especially at the beginning. Rabbi Nachman never prescribed feeling something as part of the practice. The Tikkun HaKlali operates at levels of the soul below conscious emotional experience. Recite it without feeling if that is your experience. The practice is the practice; the feeling is not the measure of the practice.

## The Tikkun HaKlali and Shame

One of Rabbi Nachman's most liberating teachings about the Tikkun HaKlali concerns the shame that prevents people from doing it.

The shame logic runs: "I have done [x]. I am too ashamed to approach God. The Tikkun HaKlali is for people who have made mistakes — but my mistake is too large, too repeated, too serious. I don't deserve to use it."

Rabbi Nachman's response: the Tikkun HaKlali exists precisely for that person. Its power is not diminished by the magnitude of the transgression. Its promise is specifically directed at the person who feels "too far gone." The person who has stumbled badly and immediately recites the Tikkun HaKlali is doing exactly what Rabbi Nachman asked.

The shame that says "I don't deserve to do this" is the yetzer hara (evil inclination) preventing you from the one practice that would most directly address your state.

## Your First Time

If you have never recited the Tikkun HaKlali:

1. Open a Tehillim (or the Tikkun HaKlali app)
2. Find Psalm 16
3. Read it, in Hebrew or English
4. Continue through 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, and end with 150
5. Give a small amount of charity
6. You have recited the Tikkun HaKlali

You do not need a rabbi's permission. You do not need to be in a synagogue. You do not need to understand the full Kabbalistic system behind it. You need only to begin.

*Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman.*

Rabbi Nachman's promise stands. The door is open. Begin.
