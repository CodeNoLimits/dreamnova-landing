11:T2d38,# What Is Shovavim? A Complete Breslov Guide to the Six Sacred Weeks

## Overview: The Six Weeks That Changed Everything

Every year in the Jewish calendar, between the Torah portions of *Shemot* and *Mishpatim* — roughly corresponding to January and February — there is a six-week period known as *Shovavim*. The word is an acronym formed from the Hebrew names of those six Torah portions: **Sh**emot, **V**aeira, **B**o, **B**eshalach, **Y**itro, **M**ishpatim.

In some years, when the Jewish leap year adds two additional months, this period extends to eight weeks and is called *Shovavim Tat* (from the words "שובבים תת" — the same six, plus *Terumah* and *Tetzaveh*).

Shovavim is not a biblical holiday. It is not mentioned in the Talmud. It emerges from the Kabbalistic tradition — particularly from the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Isaac Luria (1534–1572) — and has been given its fullest practical and spiritual expression in the Breslov movement through Rabbi Nachman and his disciples.

Understanding what Shovavim is, what it is for, and how Breslov practice engages it requires understanding one of the most challenging and most liberating dimensions of Jewish mystical teaching: the spiritual significance of sexuality and its connection to all other spiritual domains.

## The Spiritual Significance of These Six Weeks

The weeks of Shovavim cover the narrative of the Exodus: the enslavement of Israel in Egypt, the plagues, the departure, the crossing of the Red Sea, the revelation at Sinai. But in the Kabbalistic reading, this narrative operates simultaneously at a personal level.

Egypt (*Mitzrayim* in Hebrew) derives from the root *meitzar* — narrowness, constriction, limitation. The Egyptian exile is not only a national historical event. It is a symbol of the soul's captivity within its own limitations, habits, compulsions, and failures.

The primary area of captivity that Shovavim addresses is *gilui arayot* — improper sexuality, in the broad Kabbalistic sense that includes not only overt transgressions but the misuse of creative/sexual energy through fantasy, inappropriate speech, and dispersal of vital force.

The Ari taught that the period of Shovavim is a uniquely powerful time for *teshuvah* (return/repentance) in this domain specifically, because the Torah portion being read in these weeks contains the narrative of liberation from the very type of captivity that improper sexuality represents.

## Breslov's Specific Contribution to Shovavim Practice

Rabbi Nachman of Breslov elevated the Shovavim period in several ways that distinguish Breslov practice from the broader Kabbalistic tradition.

### The Tikkun HaKlali as the Central Shovavim Practice

Rabbi Nachman's *Tikkun HaKlali* — the recitation of ten specific psalms (16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150) — is described by Rabbi Nachman himself as a comprehensive repair (*tikkun*) for the full spectrum of what the Kabbalah calls *pegam habrit* (blemish of the covenant, i.e., misuse of sexual energy).

Rabbi Nachman made an extraordinary promise about the Tikkun HaKlali: that anyone who recites these ten psalms with proper intent and then gives charity will have their sin "entirely undone" — not merely forgiven, but cosmically repaired. He stated this so emphatically that his disciple Reb Noson recorded his willingness to stake his share in the World to Come on it.

During Shovavim, the practice in many Breslov communities is to recite the Tikkun HaKlali daily, rather than the standard practice of once a week or once a month. Some communities recite it twice daily during this period.

### The Additional Fast Days: Breslov's Nuanced Position

The traditional Kabbalistic Shovavim practice includes a series of fast days — one per week, or two per week in some traditions — as a form of bodily asceticism that supports spiritual repair.

Rabbi Nachman's position on fasting was complex and evolved over his lifetime. Early in his career he practiced severe asceticism, including extended fasts. Later, after his journey to the Land of Israel (1798-1799), he moved away from this approach and became critical of excessive fasting.

His teaching: **the body is not the enemy**. Fasting is not inherently holy. Excessive asceticism can damage the body and the spirit simultaneously, and a weakened body is less capable of spiritual work, not more.

The Breslov approach to Shovavim fasting is therefore measured:

- **One optional fast per week**, specifically on Monday or Thursday, if the person's health permits.
- **Priority is given to joy** (*simcha*) over mortification. If fasting makes you miserable and spiritually contracted, its value is diminished.
- **Substituting charity and learning for fasting** is explicitly endorsed by Breslov teachers — giving money to Torah scholars or to the poor "in place of" a fast is a recognized alternative.

### Hitbodedut During Shovavim: Speaking the Unspeakable

The most distinctly Breslov contribution to Shovavim is the use of hitbodedut — personal prayer — to address the specific spiritual content of this period.

Rabbi Nachman understood that shame is the primary obstacle to spiritual repair in the area of sexuality. A person who has struggled — whether with pornography, with masturbation, with infidelity, with addiction, with fantasy — carries that shame in silence, often for years. The silence is itself spiritually corrosive. It confirms the yetzer hara's (evil inclination's) strategy of making the person feel too ashamed to approach God.

Hitbodedut breaks the silence. Rabbi Nachman taught: go to a room alone and speak to God about this specifically. Name it. Not "I have sinned in this area" — but the actual content, the actual experience, the actual struggle. Speak it to God directly, in plain language, in whatever language you think in.

This practice is not confession to a human being. It is not public. It is private speech, directly to the source of all reality. And Rabbi Nachman taught that such speech — honest, direct, specific — is among the most powerful forms of prayer available.

## What Is Actually Being Repaired During Shovavim?

The Kabbalistic concept of *pegam habrit* requires some unpacking for the modern person approaching Shovavim.

The *brit* (covenant) in Jewish mysticism refers to the covenant of sexuality — the sacred nature of the procreative capacity. In the Lurianic Kabbalah (which deeply influenced Rabbi Nachman), the misuse of sexual energy has a specific cosmological consequence: it strengthens the *klipot* (husks, forces of spiritual obstruction) and weakens the *kedushah* (holiness) of the person and the world.

Rabbi Nachman translates this cosmology into a psychology: misuse of sexual energy — in whatever form — creates a *lifgam* (blemish) in the person's spiritual clarity, their ability to pray with focus, their capacity for genuine intimacy, their connection to their own soul. The repair (*tikkun*) of this blemish is the subject of Shovavim practice.

Importantly, this framework is not about punishment or divine disgust. Rabbi Nachman is explicit that God's love for every person is unconditional and that no spiritual damage is irreparable. The repair is available. Shovavim is simply a time when the cosmic window for that repair is particularly open.

## The Connection Between Shovavim and the Exodus Narrative

The connection between these six Torah portions and sexual repair is not arbitrary. The Lurianic tradition reads the Exodus narrative as a map of the soul's liberation from its own captivity.

Egypt represents all the places where vital energy is trapped: in compulsion, in habit, in shame, in the endless cycle of desire and regret. The ten plagues represent ten successive disruptions to the ego's defenses — each one breaking down a different layer of the self's attachment to its own limitations.

The crossing of the Red Sea is the moment of rupture — the decisive breakthrough — when what seemed permanently closed opens. In the Shovavim reading, this moment of breakthrough is available to every person who commits to the practice of these six weeks: genuine teshuvah that crosses from the "Egypt" of compulsive patterns into the freedom of a restored relationship with one's own sacred energy.

The revelation at Sinai — which occurs at the end of the Shovavim period — represents the reception of divine light that becomes possible once the clearing work has been done. In Breslov practice, the end of Shovavim ideally corresponds to a genuine sense of spiritual renewal: lighter, clearer, more connected, with the shame transformed into something more constructive.

## Practical Shovavim Protocol: What to Do Each Week

### Week One (Parashat Shemot): Recognition
The first week is for *hakarat hacheit* — recognizing the specific patterns you want to address. Hitbodedut specifically about: "What is my Egypt? Where am I enslaved?" Recite Tikkun HaKlali daily.

### Week Two (Parashat Vaeira): Naming
Speak in hitbodedut the specific content of your struggle. Name it precisely. Give charity commensurate with the seriousness of your intent.

### Week Three (Parashat Bo): Commitment
Make a specific, achievable commitment for the period: e.g., "I will recite Tikkun HaKlali every day this week" or "I will not open social media alone after midnight." The commitment must be concrete and achievable.

### Week Four (Parashat Beshalach): The Hard Week
This is traditionally when the practice becomes most difficult — corresponding to the moment before the Red Sea crossing when the Israelites faced the sea in front and the Egyptian army behind. Keep the practice. Recite Tikkun HaKlali even when you don't feel like it.

### Week Five (Parashat Yitro): Learning
Study one teaching about kedushah (holiness) and sexuality. The Breslov texts *Likutey Halakhot* (Reb Noson's legal-mystical writings) and *Sha'ar HaKedushshah* (Rabbi Chaim Vital) are primary sources.

### Week Six (Parashat Mishpatim): Integration
Complete the period with a full accounting: what changed, what remains, what the next step is. Teshuvah is not a Shovavim-only practice — it is the work of a lifetime. But Shovavim can mark a genuine turning point.

## Shovavim for Women

The traditional Shovavim literature is largely addressed to men, because the Kabbalistic category of *pegam habrit* was historically formulated in male terms. However, Breslov teachers in the modern era have increasingly addressed Shovavim practice for women.

The core elements are the same: hitbodedut, Tikkun HaKlali, charity, and intentional mikveh immersion during this period. Women are encouraged to use the weeks of Shovavim for reflection on *tzniut* (modesty) in the broadest sense — the cultivation of an inner sacred space that is not available for public consumption.

## Conclusion: Shovavim as Annual Liberation

Rabbi Nachman's vision of Shovavim is ultimately hopeful. These are not weeks of punishment or shame. They are weeks of liberation — a divinely appointed window when the spiritual work of freeing oneself from sexual compulsion, from shame, from the captivity of habit, is particularly supported by the cosmic calendar.

The person who emerges from Shovavim with even a small genuine shift — who has broken one cycle, who has spoken honestly to God about one hidden struggle, who has recited the Tikkun HaKlali with genuine intention — has participated in their own Exodus.
