11:T2cb2,# What Is Ratzon? The Complete Breslov Guide to Divine Will and Human Desire

## Ratzon: The Central Concept of Breslov Spirituality

Of all the concepts in Rabbi Nachman of Breslov's spiritual system, *ratzon* — will, desire, longing — may be the most architecturally central. While concepts like *emunah* (faith), *simcha* (joy), and *hitbodedut* (personal prayer) receive more explicit attention in beginner-level Breslov teaching, *ratzon* is the underlying force that powers all of them.

In Breslov theology, *ratzon* has two dimensions that are ultimately one: the divine will (*ratzon Elyon* — the supernal will) that creates and sustains the universe, and the human will (*ratzon ha-adam* — human desire) that either aligns with or deviates from the divine. The entire project of Breslov spiritual life can be described as the realignment of human ratzon with divine ratzon — the journey from fractured desire to unified longing.

This guide presents the complete Breslov treatment of ratzon: its metaphysical foundations, its psychological dimensions, the practices for purifying and elevating desire, and Rabbi Nachman's most radical teaching — that desire itself, even when apparently misdirected, contains a divine spark seeking its proper expression.

## The Metaphysics of Ratzon: Divine Will as Creation

### Ein Sof and the First Ratzon

In Kabbalistic cosmology, from which Rabbi Nachman draws extensively, the first act of creation was not speech but will. Before God said "Let there be light," there was the divine *ratzon* to create — the infinite longing of the Infinite to enter into relationship with a finite world.

This first divine will is what Rabbi Nachman calls *Keter* (the crown) in the Kabbalistic framework — the highest level of the divine, closest to the infinite, before any specific attribute or action. The entire created universe is an expression of this original divine will. Nothing exists except as an emanation of *ratzon Elyon*.

The spiritual implication is profound: every existing thing contains within it a trace of the original divine will. Matter itself is frozen divine desire. The human body, the physical world, even the most mundane objects — all are expressions of divine ratzon that have descended through the worlds and taken material form.

### Human Ratzon as Divine Image

The Torah's statement that the human being is created *b'tzelem Elohim* — in the image of God — is interpreted by Rabbi Nachman primarily through the lens of ratzon. The most divine-like quality of the human being is not reason (as Maimonides proposed) nor speech (as other medieval authorities suggested), but *will* — the capacity to originate desire, to long for something not yet present, to initiate change.

This radical teaching means that the human will is itself sacred — not in spite of its desires but because of them. The capacity to want, to long, to seek is the most God-like quality a person possesses. Even when this capacity is misdirected — toward harmful desires, toward material excess, toward self-destruction — the *capacity itself* is divine.

## The Psychology of Ratzon: Types of Desire

### The Three Levels of Human Desire

Rabbi Nachman distinguishes three levels of human desire in his teachings:

**Level 1 — Taavah (Appetite/Craving):** The raw desire of the body for physical satisfaction — food, sensory pleasure, comfort, safety. This is not evil in itself; the body requires these things. But taavah without spiritual elevation is desire cut off from its divine source.

**Level 2 — Chevat HaLev (The Longing of the Heart):** The deeper emotional desire for connection, meaning, love, and recognition. This is the level at which most human suffering occurs — when the heart's longing is directed at finite sources that cannot satisfy an infinite desire.

**Level 3 — Ratzon Ha-Neshama (The Will of the Soul):** The soul's deepest desire, which is always and only for *dveikut* — cleaving to the divine. This longing is constant and unbreakable, but it is often buried beneath the taavah and chevat ha-lev levels.

Rabbi Nachman's central practical teaching: spiritual life is the process of discovering that the desires you thought were for physical satisfaction or human connection are actually expressions of the soul's desire for God. The alcoholic is not seeking oblivion — they are seeking the divine bliss that only dveikut provides. The workaholic is not seeking money — they are seeking the sense of significance that only genuine divine service provides.

Every desire, traced to its root, is a desire for God.

### The Redirected Desires: Spiritual Alchemy

This teaching gives the Breslov practitioner a unique and compassionate relationship to their own desires, including their worst ones. Rather than regarding the desire for physical pleasure, for social recognition, or for material security as purely negative forces to be crushed, Rabbi Nachman teaches the practice of *ta'alumat ha-yetzer* — the transformation of the impulse.

The question is not "How do I eliminate this desire?" but "What divine quality is this desire actually seeking?"

- The desire for physical food → being redirected toward *Torah* (spiritual food) and *tefillah* (prayer as spiritual nourishment)
- The desire for human honor → being redirected toward *kavod Shamayim* (the honor of Heaven)
- The desire for physical intimacy → being redirected toward *dveikut* (intimate union with the divine)
- The desire for security and permanence → being redirected toward *emunah* (faith in divine protection)

This is not repression — it is *elevation*, the process that Kabbalah calls *ha'alat nitzotzot* (the elevation of divine sparks trapped within physical forms.

## Practical Breslov: Working with Ratzon

### Hitbodedut and Ratzon

The Breslov practice of hitbodedut — personal, unscripted prayer in your own language — is specifically designed to work with ratzon. In standard prayer, the words are given; the practitioner recites a text that shapes their spiritual reality. But in hitbodedut, the raw material is your actual desire: what do you want? What are you longing for?

Rabbi Nachman's instruction: Begin your hitbodedut by simply stating your desires honestly — including the ones you're ashamed of. Tell God what you actually want. This honesty is the beginning of authentic prayer. The shame that prevents you from naming your actual desires is itself a spiritual obstruction.

Once the desires are named honestly, the hitbodedut process naturally moves toward the deeper question: "What do I *really* want?" The surface desire (to be free of financial stress, to find a partner, to recover from illness) points toward a deeper desire (to feel safe, to feel loved, to be whole), which points toward the deepest desire (to live in genuine divine presence).

### Ratzon and Torah Study

Rabbi Nachman teaches in Likutey Moharan (Torah 44) a teaching on the relationship between ratzon and Torah study that has significant practical implications. The Torah, he says, enters the person who studies it in proportion to their *desire* for it — not their intellectual capacity, not their prior knowledge, but their yearning.

This means that the most effective preparation for Torah study is not review of prior material but the cultivation of genuine *cheshek* (enthusiasm and desire) for the learning. The student who sits down with Torah while feeling *yearning* for what it contains will penetrate farther than the student who sits down with superior knowledge but diminished desire.

Practical instruction: Before each Torah study session, spend a moment asking yourself: "What do I actually want from this learning?" and "What question is alive in me right now?" These questions activate the ratzon that makes learning genuine rather than mechanical.

### The Ratzon of Prayer: The Verse "Ratzon" in the Siddur

The verse *ratzon yerei'av ya'aseh* — "He does the will of those who fear Him" (Psalms 145:19) — appears in the daily *Ashrei* prayer. Rabbi Nachman treats this verse as a complete theology of prayer: God responds to *ratzon* — to genuine desire — not to rote recitation.

The practical teaching: The most important thing in prayer is not pronunciation, not concentration on the precise meaning of every word, but the *desire to connect*. Even a prayer said poorly, with distraction and confusion, but with genuine desire for divine connection, reaches God. The prayer of pure desire cannot fail to be heard.

## Ratzon and the Tzaddik

### The Tzaddik as Mirror of Pure Ratzon

Rabbi Nachman's teaching on the tzaddik (righteous spiritual leader) is inseparable from his teaching on ratzon. The *tzaddik ha-emet* — the true righteous teacher — is a person whose human ratzon has been fully aligned with divine ratzon. Their desires, even at the most mundane level, are expressions of divine will.

This is why attachment to the tzaddik (*deveikut be-tzaddik*) is itself a spiritual practice in Breslov. By spending time in the presence of a person whose ratzon is purified, the student's own ratzon is gradually elevated. The desire of the tzaddik becomes contagious — not through any magical mechanism but through the natural influence of one consciousness on another.

Rabbi Nachman describes this process as *hashpa'ah* (influence flowing downward): the tzaddik's purified ratzon creates a field that pulls the student's fractured desires toward their divine root.

### Hitkalelut: Nullifying the Personal Will

The most advanced Breslov teaching on ratzon is *hitkalelut* — the practice of including oneself within the will of the tzaddik and through the tzaddik within divine will. This is not the destruction of individuality but its elevation: the individual ratzon, refined through years of practice, voluntarily chooses to align with a higher will.

Rabbi Nathan describes hitkalelut as the spiritual completion of free will: "The highest use of freedom is the free choice to align your freedom with divine will." This is not servitude but the deepest form of love — the same alignment that exists between intimate partners who have so deeply known each other that their desires naturally coincide.

## Ratzon HaElyonah: The Supernal Will as Ground of Reality

Rabbi Nachman's most advanced teaching on ratzon returns to the cosmic level. In Likutey Moharan (Torah 17), he teaches that the entire created world exists in the space of divine *tzimtzum* — the divine contraction that made room for creation. But within this contracted space, divine ratzon is the constant force of support: the universe is sustained moment by moment by the divine will to maintain it.

The person who genuinely feels this — who perceives that every breath they take is an expression of divine will that they should continue existing, that every thought they have occurs within a consciousness that is itself an emanation of divine desire — lives in a state of constant profound gratitude.

This is the culmination of Breslov ratzon practice: not the achievement of particular desires, but the recognition that the capacity to desire — the fact that you are alive and wanting — is itself the greatest gift, the constant proof that divine will is present, and the open door through which genuine return becomes possible at every moment.
