3:T2712,# Rabbi Nachman and Fasting: The Real Significance of Taanit in Breslov Teaching

## The Complicated Relationship Between Breslov Hasidism and Fasting

Few topics in Breslov practice generate as much confusion — and as much misunderstanding — as fasting (*taanit*). On one hand, Rabbi Nachman himself engaged in rigorous ascetic fasting early in his life, including extended series of fasts (*taaniyot*) that severely tested his physical constitution. On the other hand, later in his life, Rabbi Nachman made statements that seem to directly discourage fasting, emphasizing joy (*simcha*) over suffering, and warning against excessive self-mortification.

Understanding Rabbi Nachman's relationship with fasting requires holding both of these truths simultaneously — and recognizing how his position evolved across his short life (he died at 38 from tuberculosis, a disease possibly exacerbated by his early asceticism).

## The Historical Context: Fasting in Jewish Mystical Tradition

Before examining Breslov's specific approach, it helps to understand the broader Jewish context. Fasting in Jewish law serves multiple functions:

- **Communal mourning**: Tisha B'Av, the 17th of Tammuz, the Fast of Gedaliah, and others mark national tragedies.
- **Personal repentance**: Yom Kippur is the paradigmatic fast of atonement. Private fasts (*taanit yachid*) can be accepted as penance for specific sins.
- **Spiritual elevation**: In Kabbalah and Hasidism, fasting was understood to weaken the physical body and thereby strengthen the soul's receptivity to divine light.
- **Tikkun (repair)**: Certain fasts were prescribed as repairs for specific spiritual errors, particularly those related to sexual transgression, oath-breaking, or desecration of holy days.

The Kabbalistic tradition, particularly the school of the Ari (Rabbi Isaac Luria, 1534–1572), prescribed elaborate systems of fasting for spiritual repair. Rabbi Nachman was deeply steeped in these traditions, having studied Lurianic Kabbalah intensively from childhood.

## Rabbi Nachman's Early Practice: The Ascetic Phase

In his youth and early adulthood, Rabbi Nachman engaged in extreme ascetic practices. His primary biographer, Rabbi Nathan of Breslov (Reb Noson), records in *Chayey Moharan* (The Life of Our Master) that Rabbi Nachman undertook *taanit b'dibur* — fasts of speech, where he would not speak a word all day — in addition to conventional food fasts.

He also engaged in the practice known as *gilgul sheleg* (rolling in snow) in winter and prolonged immersions in cold water. These were understood within the Lurianic framework as forms of self-mortification (*inuy*) designed to weaken the grip of the evil inclination and purify the soul.

Rabbi Nachman's motivation was not masochism but urgency: he felt himself called to a mission of cosmic significance — to repair the world through his spiritual work — and believed that extraordinary spiritual states required extraordinary physical sacrifice.

## The Turning Point: Rabbi Nachman's Critique of Excessive Fasting

A pivotal shift occurs in Rabbi Nachman's recorded teachings as he matures. In *Likutey Moharan* (Torah 47), he teaches:

> "The main service of God is through joy. One must really make great effort to be joyful always... for depression and sadness are extremely harmful for divine service. Accustom yourself to joy always, even if you have to use ridiculous means to achieve it."

This teaching represents a fundamental reorientation. Joy (*simcha*) is not a bonus — it is the main service. And anything that systematically destroys joy — including excessive fasting — must be approached with caution.

In *Sichot HaRan* (Conversations of Reb Noson), Rabbi Nachman warns explicitly about fasting:

> "It is not good to do many fasts. Nowadays one should not fast at all, except for the fasts that are obligatory by law. In our days, one who fasts excessively ruins and weakens the divine service."

This is a striking statement from a man who fasted so extensively in his own youth. What changed?

## Rabbi Nachman's Resolution: The Priority of Spiritual Vitality

Rabbi Nachman came to see that the purpose of all spiritual practices — including fasting — is to bring the practitioner into a more alive, more connected, more joyful relationship with God. When a practice achieves the opposite effect — when it depletes energy, increases depression, cultivates resentment, or feeds spiritual arrogance — it has failed its purpose and should be discontinued.

Fasting, in particular, carries specific risks:
1. **Physical weakness** can reduce the capacity for Torah study and prayer — which Rabbi Nachman considered far more important than mortification.
2. **Spiritual pride** (*ga'avah*) can arise when fasting becomes a form of self-congratulation or social display.
3. **Depression** is a common side effect of severe caloric restriction, and depression was Rabbi Nachman's designated primary enemy of spiritual life.
4. **Displacement**: Fasting can become a substitute for the deeper work of character transformation — it feels like doing something without requiring the hard internal work of actually changing.

## The Breslov Alternative to Fasting: Verbal Confession and Tikkun HaKlali

Rabbi Nachman proposed specific alternatives to punitive fasting that accomplish the same spiritual goals with less physical and psychological cost:

### Verbal Confession (Vidui)
In *Likutey Moharan* (Torah 6), Rabbi Nachman teaches extensively about the power of verbal confession before God. When a person speaks their wrongdoings aloud — honestly, without evasion, in personal prayer — this has the spiritual efficacy of a fast without the physical cost. The shame of confession, he teaches, is itself a purifying fire.

### Tikkun HaKlali
Rabbi Nachman's most famous teaching about spiritual repair is the Tikkun HaKlali — the General Remedy consisting of ten specific Psalms. He declared this to be an all-purpose repair for the full spectrum of spiritual errors, including the transgressions that classical tradition prescribed heavy fasting for.

The Tikkun HaKlali (Psalms 16, 32, 41, 42, 59, 77, 90, 105, 137, 150) was presented by Rabbi Nachman as superior to fasting precisely because it is an act of turning to God in joy and trust, rather than in punitive self-denial. He stated: "I promise that whoever comes to my grave, recites these ten Psalms, and gives a penny to charity — I will intercede for them, no matter how they have sinned."

### Hitbodedut (Personal Prayer)
An hour of genuine hitbodedut — personal, honest dialogue with God, speaking every fear and failure aloud — was prescribed by Rabbi Nachman as equivalent in spiritual value to extensive fasting and ascetic practice. "Better one hour of genuine hitbodedut than many fasts," Reb Noson records as a teaching from his master.

## Obligatory Fasts: What Breslov Does Observe

It's important to clarify: Breslov does not reject obligatory fasting (*taaniyot d'rabim*). These include:
- **Yom Kippur**: The holiest day of the Jewish year; fasting is biblical law.
- **Tisha B'Av**: Mourning the destruction of the Temples.
- **17th of Tammuz, Fast of Gedaliah, 10th of Tevet**: Rabbinic fasts connected to national tragedies.
- **Fast of Esther**: The day before Purim.

Breslov practitioners observe all of these. What Rabbi Nachman discouraged were **private, voluntary fasts** (*taanit yachid*) undertaken for self-punishment or spiritual ambition, particularly when they conflict with the primary imperative of maintaining joyful spiritual vitality.

## The Fast of the Soul: A Breslov Reinterpretation

Rabbi Nachman's most beautiful contribution to the theology of fasting is his teaching on the "fast of the soul." Physical fasting, he taught, is at most a preparation for something deeper: the fasting of the soul from spiritual emptiness, distraction, and disconnection from God.

The soul's true fast is the hour of hitbodedut: withdrawing from all noise, all screens, all social performance, and simply being present before the Infinite in silence or speech. This is the hunger the soul actually feels — not hunger for food, but hunger for genuine encounter with the Divine.

In this sense, every practitioner of hitbodedut is fasting every day — not from food, but from the distractions that normally prevent the soul from arriving where it belongs.

## Fasting in the Digital Age: A Breslov Perspective

Modern secular culture has developed its own relationship with fasting through intermittent fasting, juice cleanses, and other health-oriented practices. Breslov teaching does not oppose any of these — what a person does with their body for health reasons is a matter of practical wisdom.

But Breslov would add: even if you fast for health reasons, use the fast *also* as a spiritual opportunity. When you feel hunger and choose not to eat — even briefly — you are practicing the exact neurological pattern that spiritual practice requires: feeling a pull and choosing something else. Use that moment to speak to God. Use the physical discomfort as an anchor back to the question: "What does my soul actually need today?"

## Conclusion: Fasting Is a Tool, Not the Goal

Rabbi Nachman's teaching on fasting ultimately resolves into a clear hierarchy: **the goal is love of God and joy in divine service**. Fasting is a tool that may serve this goal in specific contexts and for specific people. When it serves — use it. When it harms — don't.

The Breslov practitioner who wants to "do something serious" about their spiritual life is invited not to fast, but to commit to daily hitbodedut, to the recitation of Tikkun HaKlali, to the study of Likutey Moharan, and to the cultivation of genuine, ridiculous, stubborn simcha — joy that persists even through difficulty.

That, says Rabbi Nachman, is the real fast. The fast from ordinary consciousness.
