11:T2d35,# Breslov Teachings on Anger and Jealousy: Rabbi Nachman's Complete Guide

## Two Poisons That Destroy Inner Life

Of all the difficult emotions catalogued in Jewish ethical literature (*mussar*), anger and jealousy receive the most severe treatment. The Rambam (Maimonides) calls anger "a very bad character trait" and instructs that a person should distance themselves from it to the extreme. The Talmud compares the person who worships idols to the person who gives in to anger. Jealousy — *kinah* in Hebrew — the Mishnah names as one of the three things that "remove a person from the world."

Rabbi Nachman of Breslov does not contradict this severity. But he adds something that the earlier ethical literature often lacks: a practical spiritual psychology of why these emotions arise, what they are truly expressing, and how the specific practices of Breslov teaching — hitbodedut, Azamra, music, joy — address them at their root.

## Understanding Anger in Breslov: The Theology of Rage

### Where Anger Actually Comes From

Rabbi Nachman's analysis of anger begins in an unexpected place: the teaching on *emunah* (faith). He draws a direct line between a deficiency in emunah and the susceptibility to anger.

The logic is this: anger arises when reality does not conform to our expectations or our will. We have a model of how things should be — how people should treat us, how our plans should unfold, how the world should work — and when that model is violated, the frustrated will expresses itself as rage.

But what is that model based on? In the Breslov analysis, it is based on the implicit belief that we are in control — that our plans, our rights, our desires should determine outcomes. Anger is, at its root, a protest against the limitation of human control.

Emunah — genuine trust in divine providence — does not say that what happened to you was good or fair. It says that the outcome of events is ultimately in God's hands, not yours. A person with deep emunah can still feel disappointed, hurt, or wronged — but the specific additional layer of rage that comes from believing "this should not have happened because I willed otherwise" is defused by the emunah framework.

Rabbi Nachman puts it directly: **anger is contracted emunah**. The angrier a person is, the more contracted their awareness of divine presence in the situation.

### The Warning of the Angry Person

Rabbi Nachman draws on the Talmudic teaching that "when a person becomes angry, if he is a scholar, his wisdom leaves him; if he is a prophet, his prophecy leaves him." He uses this to teach something important about anger's spiritual mechanism:

Anger closes the channels. Not metaphorically — in the Breslov understanding, there are actual spiritual channels through which *da'at* (deep knowledge, awareness) flows into a person. Anger — not just the emotion but the habitual orientation of the angry personality — systematically closes these channels.

This is why the angry person consistently makes worse decisions, alienates the very people they need, and cannot access the wisdom they otherwise possess. The anger itself creates the conditions that generate more anger.

### Breaking the Anger Cycle: Breslov Methods

**Hitbodedut for anger**: Rabbi Nachman prescribes speaking the anger to God before it explodes onto human targets. "I am furious about [specific thing]. I want to hurt someone. I feel out of control." This is not therapy — it is a spiritual technology for redirecting the angry energy from destructive horizontal expression (at people) to vertical expression (at God, who can receive it without being destroyed by it).

**The pause**: Rabbi Nathan, Reb Noson, writes extensively in *Alim LiTerufah* (his collected letters) about the importance of the physical pause before responding in anger. Before speaking in anger, before sending the message, before walking into the room — pause. Use that pause for even thirty seconds of internal speech to God.

**Azamra after anger**: For people who have acted from anger and are dealing with the aftermath — the hurtful words said, the relationships damaged, the regret — Azamra is the antidote to the shame spiral. Find the one genuine thing you did right in that interaction, even if it was only that you stopped before saying something worse.

## Understanding Jealousy in Breslov: The Theology of Envy

### What Jealousy Is Really Saying

Rabbi Nachman's analysis of jealousy (*kinah*) is as psychologically precise as his analysis of anger. He identifies the primary driver of jealousy: **the belief that another person's success diminishes yours**.

This is a belief about divine economics — that divine blessing is a finite resource, that the blessing given to another is therefore less available for you. Rabbi Nachman attacks this belief directly: the divine is infinite. Another person's success does not deplete the pool from which your success could come.

But he goes further. Jealousy also contains a hidden statement about your own worth: "If I see that person as successful and myself as less successful, it must mean I am worth less." Jealousy is often a comparison in which you are always on the losing end — because you know your own full reality (including all your failures, doubts, and limitations) while comparing it to another person's carefully curated external presentation.

### The Breslov Teaching on Comparing Spiritual Paths

Rabbi Nachman was particularly concerned about jealousy in the spiritual domain — the comparison of one person's spiritual level, achievements, or connection to God with another's. He called this *kinah b'avodah* (jealousy in spiritual service) and considered it one of the most insidious spiritual problems precisely because it masquerades as aspiration.

"I want to be like that tzaddik" can be genuine aspiration. Or it can be the yetzer hara's mechanism for making you permanently dissatisfied with your own path, your own level, your own growth. Rabbi Nachman teaches: **each soul has its own path**. What is required of you is not the spiritual achievement of anyone else. It is the full expression of your own *tafkid* (unique divine mission) — which no one else can fulfill and no one else should be compared to.

The Talmudic teaching that "there is no jealousy in the trade" (*ein kinah b'veit hamidrash*) — originally meaning that scholars do not feel jealous of each other's success — is given a broader meaning in Breslov: the person genuinely on their own path cannot be jealous of another's path, because they are not running the same race.

### The Connection Between Jealousy and *Ayin Hara* (Evil Eye)

In Breslov teaching, jealousy and the *ayin hara* (evil eye) are spiritually connected. The concept of ayin hara in Jewish mysticism is not superstition — it is a description of a spiritual dynamic: intense, resentful attention directed at someone else's good fortune has an actual negative effect, both on the target of the jealousy and on the jealous person themselves.

The mechanism Rabbi Nachman describes: jealousy creates a channel of negative spiritual energy between the jealous person and the person they envy. The jealous person constantly channels their awareness into what the other person has, what they lack, the injustice of the gap. This constant channeling depletes the jealous person's own creative and spiritual energy.

The antidote is not to stop noticing others' success. It is to genuinely bless it — to actually want the other person to succeed, to feel genuine happiness at their good fortune. This practice, called *simchat chaveiro* (joy in the joy of one's fellow), is in Breslov teaching one of the highest spiritual achievements available to a person.

### Practical Breslov Practice for Jealousy

**Recognizing the specific target**: In hitbodedut, name the person you feel jealous of and what specifically triggers the jealousy. "I feel jealous of [name] because they have [x]." The precision is important — vague "I shouldn't feel jealous" is less useful than specific naming.

**Finding your own point of sufficiency**: Azamra applied to jealousy — find one thing you have, one quality you possess, one blessing in your life that is genuine and present. Build your sense of worth from that point, not from the comparison.

**Blessing the envied person**: Rabbi Nachman prescribes the practice of explicitly wishing another person well in your private prayer — specifically the person toward whom you feel jealous. "I want [name] to succeed and to be blessed." This is not natural and will not feel natural immediately. It is an act of will that retrains the spiritual orientation away from competition and toward abundance.

**Disconnecting self-worth from comparative achievement**: The deepest Breslov practice for jealousy is the sustained cultivation of a sense of self-worth that is grounded in your relationship with God rather than in comparison with others. "God knows who I am and what I am working with. My value is not determined by whether [name] has more than me."

## Anger and Jealousy Together: The Compound Poison

Rabbi Nachman understood that anger and jealousy often operate together in a compound pattern. Jealousy generates persistent frustration about the gap between what others have and what you have. That frustration eventually finds an outlet as anger — at the person you envy, at circumstances, at God.

The Breslov approach to this compound pattern:

1. **Name both layers** in hitbodedut — the jealousy first, then the anger that flows from it.
2. **Tikkun HaKlali** — recited daily during periods of intense struggle with these emotions, because Rabbi Nachman taught that the repair of sexuality-related spiritual damage also heals the broader spiritual field, including the susceptibility to anger and jealousy.
3. **Joy as the antidote to both** — Rabbi Nachman's teaching that *mitzvah gedolah lihyot besimcha tamid* (it is a great mitzvah to always be in joy) is not a command to suppress anger and jealousy. It is the identification of the positive spiritual state that leaves least room for these negative ones.

The person in genuine simcha — joy that is grounded in the awareness of their own good, their own path, their own relationship with God — has no purchase point for jealousy (because they are not measuring their worth comparatively) and minimal fuel for anger (because their emunah gives them a framework for accepting what happens without the protest of absolute will).

## Conclusion: Liberation From the Inner Tyrants

Rabbi Nachman calls anger and jealousy *tyrants* — not external tyrants but internal ones. The person who is slave to their anger is not free, even if they are materially successful. The person who is consumed by jealousy does not enjoy what they have, because they are always measuring it against what others have.

Breslov's vision of spiritual freedom includes freedom from these inner tyrants. Not through suppression — which merely drives them underground — but through the deep transformation that comes from prayer, from joy, from the Azamra practice, and from the sustained cultivation of emunah.

The free person is not the one who never feels anger or jealousy. It is the one who knows what to do with those feelings when they arise, who has a practice that addresses them at their root, who does not mistake their emotional reactions for reality.

*Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman.*

Your freedom is possible. The practice exists. Begin.
