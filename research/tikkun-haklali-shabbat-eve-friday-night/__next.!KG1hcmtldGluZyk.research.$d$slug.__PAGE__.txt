3:T2792,# What Is Tikkun HaKlali for Shabbat Eve? The Friday Night Practice Explained

## The Most Powerful Spiritual Practice in the Breslov Calendar

If you've spent time in Breslov circles, you've heard about Tikkun HaKlali — the General Remedy. But a specific question comes up repeatedly among serious practitioners: **Should Tikkun HaKlali be recited on Friday night (Shabbat eve), and what is its special significance at that time?**

This article answers that question comprehensively, drawing on authoritative Breslov sources and practical guidance for modern practitioners.

## What Is Tikkun HaKlali?

Tikkun HaKlali (תיקון הכללי) — literally "the General Rectification" — is a sequence of ten specific Psalms that Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (1772–1810) designated as a complete spiritual repair (*tikkun*) for the broadest category of spiritual transgression.

The ten Psalms, in the order Rabbi Nachman specified, are:

1. **Psalm 16** (*Michtam L'David*)
2. **Psalm 32** (*L'David Maskil*)
3. **Psalm 41** (*L'Menatzeach Mizmor L'David*)
4. **Psalm 42** (*L'Menatzeach Maskil Livnei Korach*)
5. **Psalm 59** (*L'Menatzeach Al Tashet*)
6. **Psalm 77** (*L'Menatzeach Al Yedutun*)
7. **Psalm 90** (*Tefillah L'Moshe*)
8. **Psalm 105** (*Hodu L'Hashem*)
9. **Psalm 137** (*Al Naharot Bavel*)
10. **Psalm 150** (*Halleluyah Halelu El b'Kodsho*)

Rabbi Nachman revealed this combination in *Likutey Moharan* (Torah 29) and made an extraordinary promise about it: "I have revealed a remedy so that if a person falls into sexual sin, there is a repair... When one comes to my grave and recites these ten Psalms, gives any amount to charity, and has confidence in my teachings — I will stand and intercede for them, no matter how they have sinned."

## The Connection Between Tikkun HaKlali and Shabbat

The relationship between Tikkun HaKlali and Shabbat is multilayered:

### Shabbat as Tikkun (Rectification)
In Kabbalah, Shabbat itself is understood as a *tikkun* — a rectification of the entire week. The Zohar teaches that Shabbat is the culmination and correction of all the spiritual work (and spiritual failures) of the six days of creation. When a person enters Shabbat in a state of spiritual incompleteness — having stumbled in their conduct during the week — the Shabbat energy can either elevate or further burden them, depending on their state of preparation.

### Friday Night as the Gate
In Breslov tradition, the period of *Erev Shabbat* (Shabbat eve, Friday afternoon until nightfall) is considered a particularly powerful spiritual gate. The *Shekhinah* (Divine Presence) is said to descend into the world at this time, and the spiritual atmosphere carries an elevated capacity for repair and renewal.

Rabbi Nathan of Breslov (*Reb Noson*), in *Likutey Halakhot* (Laws of Shabbat), extensively connects the Friday night transition with the concept of *bechina* (aspect) of the *Tzaddik* — the righteous person who serves as a conduit between the higher and lower worlds. The recitation of Tikkun HaKlali at this gate moment is particularly potent.

## When to Recite Tikkun HaKlali on Friday Night

There are two primary schools of practice:

### Before Kabbalat Shabbat (Accepting Shabbat)
Some Breslov communities and individuals recite Tikkun HaKlali *before* the Friday night prayer — either in the late Friday afternoon or at the onset of twilight (*bein hashemashot*). The reasoning: this completes the week's spiritual accounting *before* entering the holy time, arriving at Shabbat in a cleared state.

### After the Shabbat Night Meal
Others prefer reciting Tikkun HaKlali after the Friday night meal and prayer, during the late hours of Friday night. The reasoning: the spiritual light of Shabbat is now fully present, and the Psalms ascend with added power. Some also point to the tradition of reciting Tikkun HaKlali at midnight (*chatzot*), when the gates of heaven are considered particularly open.

### The Practical Recommendation
Most contemporary Breslov authorities, including those associated with the Moharosh (Rabbi Shalom Arush), recommend the following for those who want to establish a consistent practice:

1. **Ideally**: Friday afternoon before Shabbat, after completing any work preparation.
2. **Alternatively**: Any time from Friday nightfall through Saturday night (Shabbat itself).
3. **Minimum**: At least once over the Shabbat period if you cannot do it every week.

## Special Kavvanot (Intentions) for Friday Night Tikkun HaKlali

Rabbi Nathan teaches in *Alim LiTerufah* (his collected letters) that the intention when reciting Tikkun HaKlali on Shabbat eve should include:

1. **Acknowledgment of the week's failures**: Before beginning, take one minute to silently or verbally acknowledge to God any ways in which you fell short during the week — in thought, speech, or action.

2. **Request for Shabbat elevation**: Ask that the merit of the Tikkun HaKlali help you enter Shabbat in a state of spiritual wholeness (*shalem*), connected to the source of your soul.

3. **Connection to the Tzaddik**: In Breslov practice, connecting to Rabbi Nachman's spirit through Tikkun HaKlali is considered an intrinsic part of the practice. Mentally addressing him — "I am reciting these Psalms through your guidance" — is encouraged.

4. **Charity beforehand**: If possible, give any amount to charity before reciting. This is explicitly stated in Rabbi Nachman's promise regarding the Tikkun HaKlali.

## Why These Ten Specific Psalms?

Rabbi Nachman was characteristically cryptic about why these exact Psalms were chosen, and he explicitly said that their selection involved esoteric knowledge ("a great secret"). However, later Breslov commentators have identified several thematic threads:

- **Psalms 16 and 32** deal with trust in God and the joy of forgiveness — they set the frame: God is ready to forgive.
- **Psalms 41 and 42** address the anguish of spiritual disconnection and the soul's deep thirst for return.
- **Psalm 59** is associated with protection against spiritual enemies — the internal forces that pull a person toward transgression.
- **Psalm 77** addresses the crisis of faith — "Has God forgotten me?" — and its resolution through remembering divine miracles.
- **Psalm 90** (Moses's prayer) addresses human mortality and the urgency of spiritual return before it is too late.
- **Psalm 105** is a historical psalm of gratitude, reorienting the mind toward all that God has given.
- **Psalm 137** (By the rivers of Babylon) is associated with exile and the anguish of separation from the Divine.
- **Psalm 150** is pure praise — the declaration that even after all the failures and repairs, life culminates in gratitude.

Together, the ten Psalms trace the arc of a complete spiritual cycle: from trust through transgression, through anguish, through return, through gratitude, to joy.

## Tikkun HaKlali and the Shabbat Soul (Neshamah Yeterah)

Jewish tradition teaches that on Shabbat, each person receives an *additional soul* (*neshamah yeterah*) — an elevated spiritual dimension that is present only on Shabbat and departs at its conclusion (*havdalah*).

Breslov teaching suggests that the capacity to fully receive this additional soul — to genuinely feel the elevation, rest, and joy of Shabbat rather than just going through its motions — depends significantly on the state of spiritual cleanliness one brings into Shabbat. Tikkun HaKlali on Friday is precisely this preparation: clearing the spiritual residue of the week so that the additional soul can arrive and be felt.

Many practitioners report that Shabbat observed after a sincere Friday-eve Tikkun HaKlali feels qualitatively different — more peaceful, more joyful, more real — than Shabbat observed without it.

## Tikkun HaKlali for Non-Religious Practitioners

One of the most beautiful aspects of Rabbi Nachman's Tikkun HaKlali promise is its universality. He did not say "for those who keep Shabbat" or "for Torah scholars." He said: "I will stand and intercede for them, no matter how they have sinned."

This openness makes Tikkun HaKlali particularly significant for people who identify as Jewish but don't currently observe Shabbat or other mitzvot — people sometimes called "non-observant" or "secular." The Breslov tradition has always been uniquely welcoming to those on the margins of observance. Rabbi Nachman explicitly sought to reach *everyone*, not only the already-pious.

For a secular Jewish person who wants to do *something* on Friday night that connects them to their heritage and to something greater — Tikkun HaKlali is an accessible, powerful starting point. No previous knowledge of Hebrew is required (though reciting in Hebrew is traditional). It takes approximately 15–20 minutes to recite all ten Psalms.

## The Nova Key as a Shabbat Practice Tool

The NFC Nova Key was designed precisely for practitioners who want a physical anchor for their Breslov practice. The act of holding the Nova Key, tapping it to activate its sacred content, and reciting Tikkun HaKlali creates a multisensory Shabbat ritual that bridges ancient practice and modern technology.

The Na Nach Nachma Nachman mantra embedded in the Nova Key serves as a bridge: it connects the user to the Breslov tradition's heart without requiring years of study. Even a single sincere recitation of *Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman* before beginning Tikkun HaKlali carries, in Breslov teaching, significant spiritual weight.

## Conclusion: A Friday Night Habit Worth Building

Tikkun HaKlali on Shabbat eve is one of the most accessible and transformative practices in the Breslov tradition. It requires:
- Ten Psalms (approximately 15–20 minutes)
- Any amount of charity beforehand
- Sincere intention to repair and return

The promise attached to it — Rabbi Nachman's personal intercession — is among the most remarkable declarations any Jewish teacher has ever made. And the experience of entering Shabbat spiritually cleared, connected, and open is available to anyone willing to try.

*Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman.*
