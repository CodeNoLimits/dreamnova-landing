11:T2e5f,# Breslov and Tisha B'Av: The Spiritual Guide to Mourning, Destruction, and Rebuilding

## Tisha B'Av in Breslov: The Deepest Dark, the Nearest Light

Of all the sacred days in the Jewish calendar, Tisha B'Av — the Ninth of Av — is the most paradoxical from a Breslov perspective. It is the day of the greatest national catastrophes: the destruction of the First Temple, the destruction of the Second Temple, the expulsion from Spain, and many other tragedies that fell on this date across Jewish history. Yet Rabbi Nachman of Breslov frames Tisha B'Av not as the nadir of darkness but as the *closest point to the light* — the day when the divine presence descends to its lowest point in history precisely in preparation for the final ascent.

This guide presents the complete Breslov understanding of Tisha B'Av: the theology of the *churban* (destruction), the spiritual meaning of the *kinot* (lamentations), the practice of mourning as *avodah* (divine service), and the extraordinary Breslov teaching that Tisha B'Av contains within it the seed of the final redemption.

## The Theology of Destruction in Breslov Thought

### Why the Temple Was Destroyed: The Breslov Analysis

In Likutey Moharan, Rabbi Nachman addresses the question of the Temple's destruction from a spiritual rather than purely historical angle. While the Talmud identifies *sinat chinam* (baseless hatred) as the cause of the Second Temple's destruction, Rabbi Nachman goes deeper: the hatred itself was a symptom of a more fundamental problem — the loss of the *tzaddik* connection.

Rabbi Nachman teaches that the Temple was the physical embodiment of the *tzaddik ha-emet* — the true righteous leader who sustains the spiritual reality of the community. When the connection between the people and their spiritual leadership was severed — through arrogance, through factional disputes, through the elevation of scholarship divorced from holiness — the physical Temple became hollow, and what was hollow could not survive the storm.

The implication for Breslov practice: mourning the Temple is not merely remembering a historical building. It is the practice of *recognizing the absence of divine connection* — the condition of spiritual homelessness — and allowing that recognition to drive genuine teshuvah.

### The Shekhinah in Exile

One of the most powerful Breslov teachings on Tisha B'Av concerns the *Shekhinah* (divine presence) itself going into exile. Rabbi Nathan of Breslov develops this teaching in Likutey Halakhot (Tisha B'Av, halakhot 1-3): the destruction of the Temple is not just the removal of a building — it is the beginning of the *galut ha-Shekhinah* (the exile of divine presence).

This means that every moment of Jewish exile since the churban is a moment in which the divine presence itself is displaced — not absent, but wandering, seeking a home, present in concealment. The Breslov mourning of Tisha B'Av is therefore a mourning *with* the divine presence rather than merely *for* a human loss.

This framing transforms the grief of Tisha B'Av into an act of solidarity with the divine. The tears shed on this day are not tears of abandonment — they are tears of shared exile, the tears of a person who feels the divine longing for return as intensely as their own longing.

## The Kinot: Lamentation as Spiritual Practice

### How to Mourn in Breslov: Active Grief

Rabbi Nachman distinguishes between two types of sadness: *atzvut* (depression, paralysis) and *histapkut* (active mourning that moves toward healing). Atzvut is categorically forbidden in Breslov — it is the condition of the person who sinks into their pain without direction. But mourning on Tisha B'Av is not atzvut — it is *histapkut* in its most elevated form.

The kinot — the lamentations of Tisha B'Av morning, written by the Rishon poets and reaching back to the book of Eichah (Lamentations) — are understood in Breslov as a spiritual technology for processing exile. Reading them with genuine feeling is not an exercise in grief for grief's sake but a *directing* of grief toward its proper spiritual destination: the longing for divine proximity.

Practical instruction: Read the kinot slowly. Do not rush. Allow each lament to land in your actual life experience — the destruction of the Temple is a template for every experience of spiritual loss you have personally lived. The person estranged from their Jewish practice, the person whose prayer feels empty, the person who cannot access genuine faith — these are all forms of the same exile that Tisha B'Av mourns.

### Eichah: The Book of Lamentations as Personal Text

Rabbi Nachman specifically recommends reading *Eichah* (the Book of Lamentations) on Tisha B'Av night as a personal meditation. The word *Eichah* — "How?" — is the first word of the book and encapsulates its entire spiritual question: *How* did this happen? *How* is this the condition we have reached?

But in Breslov reading, "How?" is also the question of *hope*: "How do we return from here?" Every verse of Eichah that describes the depth of destruction simultaneously implies the possibility of rebuilding. The acknowledgment of the fall is the first movement of the rise.

Rabbi Nathan writes: "When the person of Breslov reads Eichah on Tisha B'Av night, they should cry not only for the historical destruction but for their own inner destruction — every moment of the year when they allowed their divine connection to decay, every time they chose the world over God, every prayer said without attention. Tisha B'Av is the annual reckoning of the heart."

## Tisha B'Av as Preparation for Redemption

### The Paradox of the Mashiach's Birthday

The tradition preserved in the Talmud (Yerushalmi, Berakhot) states that the Mashiach was born on Tisha B'Av. Rabbi Nachman treats this not as a historical fact about a future individual but as a profound spiritual teaching: the redemption is *born* at the point of maximum destruction.

This is the most characteristic of all Breslov teachings in its structure: the fall contains the seed of the rise; the darkness is the womb of the light; the churban is the foundation of the binyan (rebuilding). The spiritual person who genuinely mourns on Tisha B'Av — who allows themselves to feel the full weight of the destruction — is accessing the very point where the redemption is latent.

The Breslov practice for Tisha B'Av: Do not merely perform the mourning rituals mechanically. Enter the grief fully, because it is precisely *within* the grief, at its lowest point, that the seeds of joy and rebuilding are present. The *nikudat ha-emet* (point of truth) that Rabbi Nachman teaches about — the innermost divine spark in every person that cannot be destroyed — is most accessible on Tisha B'Av, precisely because everything else has been stripped away.

### From Mourning to Consolation: The Nine Days to Tu B'Av

The nine days preceding Tisha B'Av and the seven weeks of consolation (*shiv'ah d'nechemta*) that follow it form a spiritual arc in Breslov practice. The descent through the nine days of mourning is the preparation that makes the consolation real. A consolation that bypasses the mourning is not genuine comfort but denial.

Rabbi Nachman teaches that the seven weeks of Shabbat *haftarot* of consolation that follow Tisha B'Av — read from Yeshayahu/Isaiah — are not merely historical prophecies but active spiritual medicine. Each of the seven haftarot addresses a specific dimension of the broken relationship between God and Israel, and each week of reading heals that dimension.

## The Fast and Its Spiritual Meaning

### The Five Prohibitions: An Inner Reading

The five prohibitions of Tisha B'Av — no eating or drinking, no bathing, no anointing with oil, no wearing leather shoes, and no marital relations — are understood in Breslov not only as signs of mourning but as a one-day immersion in the reality of exile.

**No eating/drinking:** The deprivation of physical sustenance mirrors the spiritual starvation of exile — the condition of being cut off from the divine source of nourishment.

**No bathing:** The refusal of physical comfort echoes the Shekhinah's condition of exile — the divine presence cannot be "bathed" in human recognition and worship when the Temple is absent.

**No leather shoes:** Leather — the skin of a living creature — represents the conquest of nature, the human capacity to transform the animal into service of the human. On Tisha B'Av, this capacity is suspended. We walk in canvas or rubber, returning symbolically to vulnerability.

**No marital relations:** The intimate union that mirrors the divine-human relationship is paused on the day that models the rupture of that relationship.

**No Torah study:** The restriction on learning Torah — which normally brings joy — is the most spiritually significant. Torah is the medium of divine-human encounter; on Tisha B'Av, even this encounter is constrained, to feel the full weight of what absence means.

### Mincha and the Beginning of Consolation

In Breslov practice, the Mincha (afternoon prayer) of Tisha B'Av carries special significance. By mid-afternoon, the tradition holds, the grief has reached its bottom and the first light of consolation begins to enter. The Tallit and Tefillin, not worn at the morning prayer (because they are called *tiferet* — beauty — and there is no beauty on the morning of destruction), are donned at Mincha.

This moment — the putting on of the Tefillin in the afternoon of Tisha B'Av — is one of the most moving in the Jewish calendar for the Breslov practitioner. It is the exact moment that Rabbi Nachman describes as the *nekudah* — the turning point where the longest night begins to become day.

## The Rebuilding: From Tisha B'Av to Rosh Hashanah

### The Psychological Arc: Mourning to Action

The weeks between Tisha B'Av and Rosh Hashanah — the month of Elul — are in Breslov practice the period of *hitbonenut* (deep reflection): processing what was mourned on Tisha B'Av and converting grief into constructive spiritual intention.

Rabbi Nathan teaches a complete psychological arc: Tisha B'Av is the moment of *acknowledging the destruction*; Elul is the month of *planning the rebuilding*; Rosh Hashanah is the moment of *committing to the rebuild*; Yom Kippur is the *receiving of divine support for the commitment*; and Sukkot is the *celebration of divine presence returning*.

The person who skips Tisha B'Av — who does not genuinely mourn the exile, the spiritual destruction, the personal distance from God — arrives at Elul without material to work with. The mourning is not an end in itself but the prerequisite for genuine teshuvah.

### The Unbreakable Promise

Rabbi Nachman's final teaching on Tisha B'Av is the one most characteristic of his entire approach: the divine promise of consolation is unconditional and unbreakable. No matter how deep the destruction, no matter how long the exile, no matter how far the individual soul has wandered — the return is guaranteed.

The verse from Isaiah, repeated seven times in the weeks of consolation: *Nachamu, nachamu ami* — "Be comforted, be comforted, My people." The double language of consolation is, in Breslov interpretation, the divine speech directly to the person who has doubted the possibility of return. The repetition says: yes, you heard correctly. Yes, this applies to you. Yes, even from this depth, the return is real.

This is the essence of the Breslov relationship to Tisha B'Av: not performance of grief, not historical commemoration alone, but the annual deep immersion in the truth of exile — which is simultaneously the truth of the inevitable return.

*Ein ye'ush ba'olam klal — There is no despair in the world at all.*

*Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman.*
