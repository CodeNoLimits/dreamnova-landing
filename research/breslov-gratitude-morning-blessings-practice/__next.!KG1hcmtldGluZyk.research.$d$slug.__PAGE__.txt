3:T2a82,# Breslov and Gratitude: Morning Blessings and the Practice of Daily Thankfulness

## Gratitude as Foundation, Not Supplement

In most self-help literature, gratitude is presented as a technique — a daily journaling practice, a mental exercise to improve mood and resilience. In Breslov Hasidism, gratitude (*hakarat hatov*, literally "recognizing the good") occupies a far more fundamental position: it is the essential precondition for all spiritual life, the lens through which reality must be viewed in order to be experienced at all.

Rabbi Nachman of Breslov (1772–1810) didn't merely recommend gratitude. He built his entire system of divine service around it, teaching that the failure to recognize and express gratitude is one of the deepest spiritual diseases — and conversely, that genuine gratitude is among the most powerful forces available to a human being.

## The Morning Blessings: Judaism's Daily Gratitude Practice

Before examining Rabbi Nachman's specific teachings, it helps to understand the traditional Jewish morning liturgy, because Breslov's gratitude practice grows directly from it.

The traditional morning blessings (*Birkhot HaShachar*) — recited immediately upon waking — are a structured gratitude practice of remarkable psychological sophistication. They include blessings for:

- **Waking from sleep**: *Modeh Ani* — "I give thanks to You, living and eternal King, for You have mercifully restored my soul within me — great is Your faithfulness."
- **The ability to see**: *Pokeach Ivrim* — "...who opens the eyes of the blind."
- **The ability to stand upright**: *Zokef Kefufim* — "...who straightens the bent."
- **The ability to wear clothing, to walk, to take each step**
- **One's Jewish identity and spiritual freedom**: *She'asani Yisrael*, *She'asani Ben/Bat Chorin*

These blessings are deliberately physical, even mundane. Before thanking God for Torah, for Israel, for miracles — Judaism teaches gratitude for consciousness itself, for the ability to open one's eyes, to breathe, to stand.

Breslov intensifies this foundational practice with Rabbi Nachman's specific teachings on gratitude.

## Modeh Ani: The First Words of the Day

In Breslov teaching, *Modeh Ani* — the brief prayer said before even getting out of bed — is given enormous significance. The prayer reads:

*"Modeh ani lefanecha Melech chai ve'kayam, she'hechezarta bi nishmati b'chemla — rabbah emunatecha."*

"I give thanks before You, living and eternal King, who has mercifully returned my soul to me — great is Your faithfulness."

Notice what this prayer does not say: it does not say "thank You for a good night's sleep" or "thank You for health" or "thank You for another day." It says: thank You for *consciousness itself*. For the simple miracle of waking up — of existence continuing — regardless of what the day holds.

Rabbi Nachman taught that saying *Modeh Ani* with genuine attention — really feeling the gratitude for consciousness — is a complete spiritual orientation that shapes everything that follows. The person who wakes up and immediately feels grateful for existence is fundamentally different in their daily experience from the person who wakes up and immediately begins cataloguing their problems.

## The Seven Steps of Breslov Morning Practice

Drawing on Rabbi Nathan of Breslov's (*Reb Noson*) compilation in *Likutey Halakhot* and the practical teachings of contemporary Breslov teachers, the following morning sequence reflects the Breslov approach to gratitude:

### Step 1: Modeh Ani Before Moving
Upon the first moment of consciousness, before the mind begins its habitual rush of planning, anxiety, and social-media checking: *Modeh Ani*. Say it slowly, feeling each word.

### Step 2: Hand-Washing (Netilat Yadayim)
Immediately, wash hands three times alternating. This is not merely a hygiene practice — in Breslov teaching, it is a purification of the hands for the holy work of the day. The act grounds you in the body, in the present moment.

### Step 3: Hitbodedut Gratitude (5-10 minutes)
Before the formal morning prayers, Breslov recommends a brief session of personal, spontaneous gratitude prayer. Not the liturgical blessings, but your own words: "Thank You for my wife/husband. Thank You for my health. Thank You for the specific good thing that happened yesterday. Thank You that I can see. Thank You for coffee."

This practice trains the mind to scan for good rather than scanning for threats — which is the default mode of the human nervous system. Neuroscience supports this: gratitude practices systematically shift the brain's negativity bias, reducing cortisol and increasing serotonin and dopamine baselines over time.

### Step 4: Morning Blessings (Birkhot HaShachar)
The traditional liturgical morning blessings, recited with attention rather than speed. Each blessing is a specific gratitude, and Breslov teachers emphasize saying them slowly enough to genuinely feel what you're thanking God for.

### Step 5: Torah Study
Even ten minutes of Torah study each morning — a page of Talmud, a chapter of Tanakh, a teaching from *Likutey Moharan* — is part of the morning gratitude practice in Breslov. Torah is understood as God's gift to the Jewish people, and engaging with it is itself an act of gratitude for that gift.

### Step 6: Morning Prayers (Shacharit)
The full morning prayer service (*Shacharit*), which is itself structurally a gratitude crescendo: it begins with songs of praise (*Pesukei d'Zimra*), moves through the *Shema* (declaration of divine unity), and reaches its peak in the *Amidah* — the standing prayer that explicitly thanks God for miracles, for rain, for life.

### Step 7: One Specific Gratitude Intention for the Day
Before leaving the house or beginning work, Breslov practitioners are encouraged to set one specific gratitude intention: "Today, I will notice one moment of beauty I would otherwise have overlooked." This keeps the gratitude practice active beyond morning prayer and into daily life.

## Why Gratitude Is Spiritually Central in Breslov: The Theological Basis

Rabbi Nachman's theological basis for gratitude is rooted in the concept of *kefiyat tova* — ingratitude — as the root of spiritual failure. In *Likutey Moharan* (Torah 34), he teaches that ingratitude toward God is parallel to ingratitude toward human benefactors, and that both are symptoms of the same underlying spiritual problem: the failure to truly see who is giving to you.

When a person sees clearly — when they genuinely perceive that their existence, their health, their children, their work, their intelligence, their spiritual capacity are all gifts from an infinite source — gratitude arises naturally. It is not forced. It is the natural emotional response to actually seeing.

The problem, Rabbi Nachman teaches, is that human beings are designed to habituate. We stop seeing. The coffee becomes ordinary. The spouse becomes furniture. The morning sunrise becomes background. The heartbeat — that miraculous continuous event that has been running for your entire life without your management or attention — goes entirely unnoticed.

Gratitude practice, in Breslov, is therefore primarily an *attentional* practice: training yourself to actually see what is already there.

## The Connection Between Gratitude and Joy

Rabbi Nachman's famous teaching "It is a great mitzvah to always be joyful" (*Likutey Moharan* II, 24) is directly connected to gratitude. Joy (*simcha*) in Breslov is not a feeling that happens to you — it is a choice of orientation toward what already exists.

The depressed person and the joyful person often live in the same objective circumstances. The difference is in what they attend to. The joyful person has, through practice, trained their attention to rest on what is good, beautiful, alive, and given. The depressed person, without practice or intervention, tends toward automatic negative attention: what is wrong, threatening, insufficient, lacking.

Gratitude — specifically the morning gratitude practice — is the daily training in joyful attention. It is how simcha is actually built, step by step, morning by morning, over years.

## Gratitude for Difficulty: The Advanced Practice

Breslov doesn't stop at gratitude for obvious blessings. Rabbi Nachman's most advanced teaching on gratitude is the concept of thanking God specifically for difficulty, pain, and apparent failure.

In *Sichot HaRan*, he teaches that a person who can genuinely thank God for hardships has reached a high spiritual level — because this requires the deep conviction that everything, including suffering, comes from divine love and serves a purpose beyond what our limited perspective can see.

This is not toxic positivity — it doesn't require pretending difficulties aren't real or painful. It is a profound act of faith: "I don't understand why this is happening. But I trust that You do, and I trust that Your oversight is loving." This posture transforms the relationship with suffering from pure resistance to something more like participation.

## Daily Gratitude in Practice: Simple Implementations

For practitioners new to Breslov or looking to build a more consistent gratitude practice:

**Minimum viable practice:**
- Say *Modeh Ani* upon waking (30 seconds)
- Name three specific things you're grateful for before your first phone check (2 minutes)
- Say one morning blessing with full attention (30 seconds)

**Full Breslov morning practice:**
- *Modeh Ani* → hand-washing → 10 minutes personal hitbodedut (including gratitude) → morning blessings → Torah study → Shacharit

**For the digital age:**
The Nova Key's NFC technology can serve as a morning gratitude anchor. Touching the key upon waking, pausing for *Modeh Ani* and a brief gratitude reflection, connects the ancient practice to present-moment physical reality. The Na Nach Nachma Nachman mantra can itself function as a gratitude chant — four syllables expanding outward from a single root, like light expanding from a single source.

## Conclusion: Gratitude Is How You See

Rabbi Nachman's teaching on gratitude ultimately comes down to perception: do you see the gift, or do you see only the problem? Neither the gift nor the problem is an illusion — both are real. But the question of which one you *start* from, which one you *rest* in, which one you *return* to when disturbed — this determines the quality of your inner life more than almost any external factor.

Morning blessings are not religious performance. They are the daily training of a mind that chooses, again and again, to see what is given rather than what is missing.

That is the Breslov gratitude practice. That is, Rabbi Nachman teaches, the beginning of real spiritual life.

*Modeh Ani. Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman.*
