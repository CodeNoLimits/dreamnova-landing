# Breslov and Forgiveness: The Complete Guide to Mechila, Kapparah, and Releasing the Wound

## The Breslov Revolution in Forgiveness

In normative Jewish law, *mechila* (forgiveness, release from debt) follows a specific protocol: the offender must verbally confess, express genuine remorse, make restitution where possible, and request forgiveness from the offended party. The offended party then has an obligation to grant forgiveness after three sincere requests. This is the halakhic framework.

Rabbi Nachman of Breslov accepts this framework entirely — and then adds a spiritual dimension that transforms forgiveness from a legal transaction into a fundamental feature of spiritual liberation. In Breslov thought, the inability to forgive is not merely a failure of generosity; it is a *spiritual obstruction* that blocks the person who withholds forgiveness far more than it blocks the person who is unforgiven.

This guide presents the complete Breslov approach to forgiveness: the theology of *mechila*, the spiritual dangers of sustained resentment, the practice of self-forgiveness as prerequisite for all other forgiveness, and Rabbi Nachman's most radical teaching — that forgiving others is the path to receiving divine forgiveness, not the other way around.

## The Theology of Mechila: Release, Not Approval

### What Forgiveness Is Not

Before presenting the Breslov approach to forgiveness, it is important to clarify what *mechila* does and does not mean in this framework.

**Mechila does not mean:**
- Approving of what was done
- Pretending the harm did not occur
- Restoring the relationship to its prior state automatically
- Ignoring the need for restitution or changed behavior
- Claiming that the offense was insignificant

**Mechila means:**
- Releasing the claim of resentment from your own inner life
- Choosing not to allow the past harm to define your present relationship with the offender (even if that relationship is now over)
- Freeing yourself from the spiritual and psychological weight of sustained anger
- Removing the obstruction to your own flow of divine blessing

This distinction is crucial in Breslov practice. Rabbi Nathan of Breslov writes explicitly in Likutey Halakhot that mechila is *primarily an act performed for the benefit of the one who forgives*, not the one who is forgiven. The person who cannot forgive carries the wound constantly; the person who forgives releases the wound and frees the energy trapped within it.

### The Spiritual Mechanics of Resentment

Rabbi Nachman teaches in Likutey Moharan (Torah 12) that sustained resentment creates a *klipah* (spiritual husk) around the heart that obstructs the flow of divine light. The human heart is designed to be a vessel for divine light — for chesed (loving-kindness), for joy, for emunah (faith). When resentment occupies the heart, it does not merely coexist with these qualities; it *displaces* them.

The image Rabbi Nachman uses is of a vessel partially filled with dark liquid. Even a small amount of resentment darkens the entire vessel; you cannot have pure divine love flowing through a heart that holds active hatred.

The practical implication: the person who genuinely wants to pray with kavvanah (intention), to experience authentic joy, or to feel divine presence in their life must address the resentments that block these experiences. Forgiveness is not optional for the serious Breslov practitioner — it is a prerequisite for the entire spiritual path.

## The Three Concentric Circles of Forgiveness

### Circle 1: Forgiving Others

Rabbi Nachman teaches a specific meditation for releasing resentment toward others. Before the bedtime *Shema* — in the prayer for *kri'at Shema al ha-mitah* — the tradition includes a formula for forgiving all who have wronged you. This is not coincidental to the bedtime practice; Rabbi Nachman places it there deliberately.

Sleep is the *taste of death* in Breslov teaching — the nightly return of the soul to its divine source. If you enter this state carrying active resentment, you are bringing the resentment into the presence of the divine. The soul that carries unforgiven anger cannot cleave fully to its source; the resentment is like a weight that prevents ascent.

The bedtime mechila formula is therefore not a rote recitation but a *daily practice of soul hygiene*. Each night, you identify who wronged you that day (or in the ongoing history of your relationships), and you practice the inner movement of release: "I do not hold this against you. I release my claim. Your account with me is cleared."

**Practical instruction:** Before the bedtime Shema, take three minutes to consciously name each person you are carrying resentment toward. For each one, practice the inner movement of release. This is not a feeling you generate artificially — it begins as an act of will, a choice of the rational will over the emotional reaction. Over time, as the practice deepens, the emotional release follows the volitional one.

### Circle 2: Self-Forgiveness

Rabbi Nachman's most counterintuitive teaching on forgiveness is that *self-forgiveness is the prerequisite for all other forgiveness*, not its consequence. The person who cannot forgive themselves cannot genuinely forgive others; the resentment they hold toward their own failures projects outward onto others.

This teaching connects to one of the central Breslov principles: the prohibition on *atzvut* (depression, self-punishment). The inner voice that constantly rehearses past failures, that cannot let go of its own wrongdoings, that treats every spiritual setback as evidence of fundamental worthlessness — this voice is not the voice of genuine teshuvah. It is the voice of the *yetzer hara* masquerading as conscience.

Rabbi Nachman explicitly addresses this in Likutey Moharan (Torah 6): "The excessive sorrow over sins is itself a greater obstacle than the sins themselves." Genuine teshuvah involves *acknowledging* the wrongdoing, taking *appropriate measures* to rectify it, and then *releasing* the ongoing self-punishment. The person who cannot stop punishing themselves for a past failure has confused self-punishment with teshuvah.

**The practice of self-forgiveness in Breslov:**
1. Name the specific failure clearly — do not minimize or deny
2. Take whatever practical action of rectification is available
3. Speak the failure openly to God in hitbodedut — confess in your own words
4. Receive the divine forgiveness that is already given (Rabbi Nachman insists this is always available)
5. Release the ongoing punishment — choose, as an act of will, to stop rehearsing the failure

### Circle 3: Releasing the Complaint Against God

The most advanced level of Breslov forgiveness is what might be called *mechila toward Heaven* — the release of the complaint against God for the suffering and loss that has occurred in one's life. This is perhaps the most spiritually demanding of all Breslov practices.

Rabbi Nathan records a conversation in which Rabbi Nachman addressed directly the bitterness of people who felt that God had failed them — whose suffering felt unjustified, whose prayers seemed unanswered, whose faith had been crushed by tragedy. Rabbi Nachman did not dismiss this bitterness with pious platitudes. He acknowledged its reality and then offered a practice:

"Speak the complaint to God directly. Do not suppress the anger. Tell God that you are angry, that you feel abandoned, that the suffering seems unjust. The complaint itself, spoken honestly, is a form of prayer — perhaps the most honest form. And within the very act of voicing the complaint, the relationship is maintained. The person who screams at God is not the person who has abandoned faith; it is the person who has stopped screaming who has gone silent."

This is the *mechila of acceptance*: not the suppression of pain or the denial of injustice, but the willingness to remain in relationship with God even through the experience of divine hiddenness. The release of the complaint is not the claim that God was right to cause suffering — it is the choice to continue trusting even without understanding.

## Forgiveness and the Yamim Noraim

### Yom Kippur as Cosmic Mechila

The entire structure of Yom Kippur — the Day of Atonement — is built on the principle that divine forgiveness (*kapparah*) is always available and is made maximally accessible on this day. But the Talmud teaches explicitly: "Yom Kippur atones between a person and God; it does not atone between a person and their fellow human being."

In Breslov practice, this creates a specific Yom Kippur preparation: before Yom Kippur, you must do the work of *mechila bein adam l'chaveiro* (forgiveness between people). This is not merely a formal halakhic obligation but a spiritual one — you cannot receive divine forgiveness while carrying unresolved resentment toward others. The flow of divine forgiveness is blocked by the same obstruction that blocks your own forgiveness: the closed heart.

The traditional practice of seeking mechila from others before Yom Kippur is therefore not a social courtesy but a spiritual necessity. And equally: granting mechila when asked — releasing the other person genuinely, not grudgingly — is the act that opens your own vessel to receive the divine forgiveness of the day.

### The Daily Mechila: Not Just Annual

Rabbi Nachman's teaching is that mechila cannot wait for Yom Kippur. The practice must be daily. The person who accumulates resentments all year and then "forgives" on Yom Kippur has not practiced forgiveness — they have practiced resentment for 364 days and performed a one-day ceremony.

Genuine Breslov mechila is a *muscle* that must be exercised regularly. Small daily releases — the minor irritation at a family member, the frustration at a colleague, the resentment of a friend's slight — keep the vessel clean and available for larger divine flows.

## Mechila and Divine Blessing

Rabbi Nachman's ultimate teaching on forgiveness connects it directly to the flow of divine blessing (*shefa*). In the Kabbalistic model that Rabbi Nachman employs, divine blessing flows from above through channels into the world. These channels can be obstructed by resentment, anger, and sustained judgment — both self-directed and other-directed.

The person who practices daily forgiveness — who keeps their heart clean through regular mechila — lives in a fundamentally different material and spiritual reality than the person who accumulates resentments. This is not a metaphysical abstraction: Rabbi Nathan describes it in concrete terms in Likutey Halakhot. The person who forgives readily finds that:

- Prayers flow more easily and feel less blocked
- New opportunities arise where formerly there were obstacles
- Relationships heal in unexpected ways
- The sense of divine presence in daily life intensifies
- The experience of joy becomes more accessible

These are not rewards for good behavior — they are the natural consequences of removing the spiritual obstructions that resentment creates. The channel is cleared, and the divine flow resumes.

*Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman.*
