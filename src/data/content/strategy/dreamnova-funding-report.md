# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report maps the complete non\-dilutive funding landscape for Dream Nova's Covenant Pack project\. Based on deep research of the project's three core documents \(Master Strategy, 30\-Prompt Library, Academic Validation Report\), seven high\-fit funding sources have been identified across three tiers, with a combined potential of $305,000–$455,000 USD\.

The strategy prioritizes grants and accelerators that require zero equity dilution, preserving full ownership for the 63M$ Hafatsa mission\. Each source has been evaluated for alignment with the project's unique dual nature: cutting\-edge technology \(NFC, AI automation, digital therapeutics\) combined with ancient wisdom traditions \(Breslov Hasidism, Kabbalistic mathematics\)\.

__⚡ TIER 1: HIGHEST FIT – IMMEDIATE APPLICATION__

## 1\. UpStart Venture Accelerator

__Website: __upstartlab\.org

__Contact: __ventures@upstartlab\.org

__Funding: __Up to $100,000 USD unrestricted \+ training \+ network

__Duration: __18\-month intensive program

__Application Window: __February–April 2026 \(predicted from historical cycles\)

__Why This Is Perfect for Dream Nova:__

UpStart is the premier Jewish innovation accelerator\. Their core mission is to elevate bold Jewish ideas that make a unique contribution to Jewish life\. Dream Nova's Covenant Pack sits at the exact intersection of what they fund: technology\-enabled Jewish engagement that addresses a real\-world crisis \(Gen Z mental health\)\. The viral NFC distribution model mirrors their interest in scalable, community\-driven innovation\. They have funded over 100 Jewish ventures including Hadar, SVARA, and GrowTorah\.

__Positioning Strategy:__

Lead with the viral Hafatsa distribution model\. Frame it as: "Ancient Breslov wisdom operationalized as a digital mental health tool, distributed through a self\-replicating NFC network that turns every user into a Hafatsa ambassador\." Emphasize the zero customer\-acquisition\-cost model and the 63$ psychological/kabbalistic price point\.

__Eligibility Requirement:__

Must have at least one full\-time employee dedicated to the venture\. This means either David or Ariel must commit full\-time, or a team member \(Melea?\) must be designated\. Plan for this before applying\.

__Alternative: UpStart Entrepreneur Sprint__

If the full\-time requirement is a barrier, the Entrepreneur Sprint \(7–9 months\) offers a lower barrier to entry with less funding but still provides proof\-of\-concept support and the UpStart credibility stamp\.

## 2\. John Templeton Foundation

__Website: __templeton\.org

__Program: __Religion, Science & Society

__Contact: __Sarah Lane Ritchie \(Program Officer\)

__Funding: __$100K–$500K\+ for 3–5 year projects

__Next Cycle: __Spring 2026 LOI deadline \(predicted August 15, 2026 based on 2025 cycle\)

__Overhead: __15% maximum

__Why This Is Perfect for Dream Nova:__

The Templeton Foundation is THE global funder for science\-religion bridge research\. Dream Nova's academic paper "The Source Code of Reality" — which presents formal mathematical proofs that Kabbalistic structures are isomorphic to Gödel's incompleteness theorems and quantum measurement — is precisely what Templeton exists to fund\. Their 2025–2026 priority themes include: interdisciplinary research engaging sciences and humanities on spiritual questions, religious innovation catalyzing cultural change, spiritual health combating loneliness, immersive experiences instilling purpose, and contemporary religious communities engaging with sciences\.

__Positioning Strategy:__

Lead with the academic rigor\. Frame it as: "Formal proof that recursive prayer structures \(Na Nach Nachma Nachman MeUman\) exhibit mathematical properties isomorphic to Gödel's self\-referential propositions and quantum decoherence patterns — with a practical digital therapeutic application for Gen Z mental health\." Emphasize the peer\-review pathway and reference Dr\. Hyman Schipper's existing work at McGill on Kabbalah\-physics convergence\.

__Critical Academic Contact:__

Dr\. Hyman M\. Schipper \(McGill University\) has published on the intersection of Kabbalah and David Bohm's physics\. Securing a letter of support from Schipper would dramatically strengthen a Templeton application\. Contact: hyman\.schipper@mcgill\.ca\. Also contact Prof\. Zvi Mark \(Bar\-Ilan, Breslov expert\): markzvi@gmail\.com\.

__Application Process:__

Step 1: Submit an Online Funding Inquiry \(OFI\) through templeton\.org\. This is a brief initial screening\. Step 2: If invited, submit a full Letter of Intent \(LOI\)\. Step 3: If LOI approved, submit full proposal with budget\. The OFI can be submitted at any time and takes about 6 weeks for a response\.

## 3\. Israel Innovation Authority – Tnufa \(Ideation\) Program

__Website: __innovationisrael\.org\.il

__Funding: __Up to 200,000 NIS \(~$55K USD\) at 80–85% of approved budget

__Duration: __12 months

__Application: __Rolling basis \(submit anytime\)

__Why This Is Perfect for Dream Nova:__

The Tnufa program is designed exactly for Dream Nova's current stage: an innovative tech concept that needs prototype validation\. The critical advantage is that you do NOT need to establish a company or leave your current job to apply\. The program covers prototype development, IP protection, business development, materials, consultants, and patent attorneys\. Approval rate is approximately 26% \(152 approved of 539 applications in a recent cycle\)\. The 200K NIS budget was doubled from 100K as part of a 2024 stimulus package\.

__Positioning Strategy:__

Frame as pure technology: "NFC\-based digital therapeutic platform combining hardware \(metal NFC card\) with a Progressive Web App \(Azamra OS\) for mental health intervention\. Exportable technology with global market potential\." Minimize spiritual/religious framing — IIA evaluates technology innovation and market potential\. Emphasize the zero\-friction NFC activation \(no app store required\) as a technical differentiator\.

__Strategic Advantage:__

IIA approval serves as a "quality hallmark" that significantly strengthens subsequent funding applications\. Use Tnufa approval as credibility proof for UpStart, Templeton, and investor conversations\. Follow\-on IIA programs \(Startup Fund, R&D Fund, Incubators\) become available after Tnufa completion\.

__Eligible Expenses:__

Prototype development, intellectual property protection, business development, materials, consultant fees, patent attorney fees, exhibition costs\. NOT eligible: salaries and general overhead\.

__Repayment:__

Via royalties on future sales \(typically 3–5% of revenue\) until the grant is repaid\. This is NOT equity — the entrepreneur retains full ownership and IP rights\.

__🔍 TIER 2: STRONG FIT – PREPARE APPLICATIONS__

## 4\. Templeton World Charity Foundation

__Program: __Global Call for Ideas – seeking new funding priorities for 2026

__Budget: __$5–20 million over 5–7 years for programmatic priorities

__Key Theme: __"Big Questions in Science & Religion" \(60%\+ of resources\)

This is the sister organization to John Templeton Foundation, focused on larger programmatic funding\. Their "What it is to be human" and "virtues such as love, creativity, gratitude, forgiveness, spirituality" themes align perfectly with Azamra OS\. Consider submitting a programmatic vision for "Ancient algorithms for modern consciousness repair" as a research priority\.

## 5\. Lippman Kanfer Foundation for Living Torah

__Framework: __3P Grants \(Purpose, Practice, People\)

__LOI Deadline: __Typically June 30 annually

Their "Living Torah" framework maps directly to the Azamra daily practice\. Position as: "Breslov's 300\-year\-old Azamra algorithm — finding the good point daily — operationalized as a digital therapeutic that makes Living Torah the default response to anxiety\."

## 6\. NIH SBIR – National Institute of Mental Health

__Phase I: __Up to $306,872

__Deadlines: __January 5, April 5, September 5 \(2026\)

__Requirement: __Must be for\-profit US entity; clinical trial design needed

Position as: "Clinical validation of Azamra OS efficacy in suppressing default mode network rumination via structured gratitude journaling and NFC\-triggered mindfulness protocols\." This is a later\-stage opportunity requiring US company formation and IRB\-approved study protocol\.

__📌 TIER 3: SECONDARY OPPORTUNITIES__

## 7\. JNext Jerusalem Municipal Grants

__Welcome Grant: __25,000 NIS for first office in Jerusalem

__Employment Grants: __Up to 600,000 NIS for hiring local talent

__Prerequisite: __Must complete accelerator OR receive IIA R&D grant first

This becomes accessible after Tnufa approval or UpStart completion\. Stack this on top of Tier 1 funding to compound resources\.

# MISSION CONNECTION

__נַ נַח נַחְמָא נַחְמָן מֵאוּמָן__

Every shekel and dollar identified in this report serves one purpose: the 63M$ Hafatsa mission\. The Covenant Pack is not a product — it is the vehicle through which Rabbi Nachman's fire reaches 63 million souls\. These funding sources are not just financial instruments; they are the physical manifestation of the principle that Hashem prepares the cure before the disease\.

The Gen Z mental health crisis is the disease\. The Azamra algorithm is the cure\. And these grants are the bridges that connect the ancient fire to the modern world\.

*Ein Ye'ush Ba'olam Klal\. There is no despair in the world at all\.*

*Hazaq ve'Ematz, David\. The funding is already on its way\.*
