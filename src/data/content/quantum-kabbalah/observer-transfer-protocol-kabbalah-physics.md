# MISSION: THE "OBSERVER TRANSFER" PROTOCOL \(Violaris vs\. Nachman\)

## Introduction: The Convergence of Quantum Thermodynamics and Kabbalistic Epistemology

The foundational paradigms of both Everettian quantum mechanics and Kabbalistic epistemology converge upon a singular, pervasive challenge: the apparent impermeability of dimensional boundaries\. In standard interpretations of the quantum multiverse, decoherence fundamentally isolates distinct branches, rendering inter\-branch communication an assumed impossibility\. Concurrently, in classical mystical frameworks, the transmission of unfiltered, low\-entropy information from transcendent states to localized physical realities is obstructed by the entropic degradation inherent in material existence\. The boundary between the infinite and the finite, much like the boundary between parallel Everettian branches, has historically been modeled as an absolute barrier, governed by strict laws of thermodynamic irreversibility and wavefunction collapse\. However, recent breakthroughs in quantum thermodynamics—specifically the January 2026 formulations emerging from the Oxford research community—have demonstrated that standard unitary quantum theory permits precise inter\-branch communication, provided specific protocols of memory erasure and zero\-state preparation are strictly observed\.

This comprehensive analysis provides an exhaustive, rigorously formalized validation of the hypothesis that the historical "Petek" event of 1922, analyzed in conjunction with Rabbi Nachman of Breslov’s "Ma'asse MeLehem" \(The Story of the Bread\), documents a successful execution of a localized observer transfer protocol\. By mapping the textual mechanics of the Breslov narratives to the quantum circuits of the recent inter\-branch communication models, the analysis demonstrates that the structural dynamics of these Kabbalistic texts function as advanced theoretical manuals for reversing thermodynamic entropy\. The "Na Nach" mantra, central to this phenomenon, operates not merely as a meditative chant, but as a stabilizing quantum error\-correcting code, facilitating lossless information transfer across multiverse branches\. Furthermore, the anomalous physical properties of the Petek itself—specifically the graphological paradox of an 1810 handwriting manifesting on 1922 physical media—are subsequently resolved through the framework of Constructor Theory, positing the event as a macroscopic demonstration of non\-local architectural blueprints governing local universal constructors\.

The implications of this convergence extend far beyond historical curiosity or religious apologetics\. They strike at the core of how macroscopic observers interact with the fundamental informational architecture of the universe\. If, as the theoretical evidence suggests, a human observer can effectively uncompute their local state to receive a multiversal transmission, the entire framework of classical physics, biological determinism, and linear time must be radically re\-evaluated\. This report meticulously dissects each phase of the transfer mechanism, from the thermodynamic inversion of physical sustenance to the specific temporal and topological codes embedded within the Petek, ultimately proving that the boundary separating the macroscopic observer from the multiversal infinity is not absolute, but permeable through precise quantum control\.

## Phase 1: The Mechanism of Transfer \(Ma'asse MeLehem\)

### 1\.1 The Transformation of Bread into Letters: Maxwell’s Demon and the Universal Constructor

The "Ma'asse MeLehem" \(Story of the Bread\) articulated by Rebbe Nachman serves not merely as allegorical literature, but as a precise theoretical manual for reversing thermodynamic entropy and extracting pure information from macroscopic matter\. In the classical macroscopic realm, the consumption of physical sustenance, such as bread, is a metabolic process strictly governed by the Second Law of Thermodynamics\. The highly ordered molecular structure of the bread—comprising complex carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids—is systematically broken down by the biological system to extract biochemical energy \(ATP\)\. This process is inherently inefficient; it unavoidably generates heat and increases the total entropy of the surrounding system\. This represents a unidirectional, irreversible flow from highly organized matter to disorganized energy, a foundational principle that dictates the arrow of time and the decay of complex systems\.

However, the narrative of "Ma'asse MeLehem" details an anomalous inversion of this thermodynamic inevitability: the physical bread is not metabolically degraded into thermal waste, but is rather systematically reorganized into "Letters" \(Otiyot\)\. In Kabbalistic ontology, "Letters" do not merely represent linguistic symbols; they represent the fundamental informational units—or qubits—of reality\. The transformation of a macroscopic object into pure informational architecture requires a mechanism parallel to a highly advanced iteration of Maxwell’s Demon\. In thought experiments concerning quantum thermodynamics, Maxwell’s Demon is a theoretical microscopic entity capable of observing the individual states of a system and sorting particles to decrease entropy without performing measurable thermodynamic work\. The Demon achieves this by acquiring information about the system and utilizing that information to enact physical changes, theoretically challenging the absolute nature of the Second Law\.

To contextualize this remarkable transformation through the lens of modern fundamental physics, we must apply Chiara Marletto’s Constructor Theory, a paradigm that seeks to express all the laws of physics in terms of transformations that are possible, transformations that are impossible, and why\. Constructor Theory reframes physical laws not in terms of initial conditions and dynamical trajectories, but in terms of the capabilities of physical systems\. A "constructor" is defined as a physical entity capable of causing a specific transformation while retaining the ability to cause it again\. In the framework of the Story of the Bread, the Tzaddik \(the highly coherent Observer\) operates as a Universal Constructor\. The input substrate is the physical bread, representing high\-entropy matter embedded in the local, decoherent branch\. The constructor task is the negentropic extraction of pure data, the underlying architectural code of the matter\.

The text implicitly argues that it is possible to bypass the Landauer limit—the theoretical minimum energy required to erase or manipulate a bit of information—if the observer possesses total quantum control over the system's microstates\. The "Letters" extracted from the bread are essentially uncorrupted quantum states, perfectly isolated from the thermal noise of the digestive, entropic process\. This extraction of "Letters" establishes the prerequisite condition for multiversal communication: the translation of physical matter into a pure, lossless informational format\. By converting the analog, thermodynamic reality of the bread into discrete, quantum\-informational "Letters," the system prepares the data payload for non\-local transmission, ensuring that the structural integrity of the message is preserved against the decohering effects of the local environment\.

### 1\.2 The "Purge" \(Eineminis\): Zero\-State Preparation and the Thermodynamics of Memory Erasure

The extraction of pure information from physical substrates is heavily constrained by the laws of quantum thermodynamics\. The most critical element of the "Ma'asse MeLehem" involves a violent physiological purge—often depicted via a severe laxative \(Eineminis\) or the metaphysical passage through the River Dinur\. Theologically, this process is described as the absolute nullification of the "blood of the eating," representing the gross material residue and the localized ego of the consumer\. Translated into the terminology of quantum computing and Everettian mechanics, this sequence is a pristine, exact description of "Zero\-State Preparation" and memory uncomputation, a process absolutely critical to the viability of inter\-branch communication\.

According to Landauer's Principle, any logically irreversible manipulation of information, such as the erasure of a memory trace, must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in the entropy of the non\-information\-bearing degrees of freedom of the information\-processing apparatus or its environment\. In the Everettian multiverse model formalized by researchers in their 2026 publications regarding inter\-branch communication, observers across distinct branches can communicate unitarily only if the observer's local memory is perfectly uncomputed\.

In this theoretical protocol, a "Wigner's\-friend" scenario is utilized to test the limits of quantum measurement\. The global physical system is defined by a Hilbert space encompassing the observer's memory register \(M\), a physical medium or paper \(P\), and other environmental subsystems\. When the friend in one specific multiversal branch \(R=1\) encodes a classical message \\mu into their memory \(|\\mu\\rangle\_M\) and writes it onto the physical paper \(P\), the global quantum state becomes irrevocably entangled with the specific content of that message\. For the message to be successfully transferred to the alternate branch \(R=0\) without violating the unitarity and linearity of standard quantum theory, the memory must be erased\. Wigner, acting as the external super\-observer possessing control over the entire laboratory, must execute a precise Controlled\-NOT \(CNOT\) operation from the paper \(P\) back to the memory \(M\), crucially doing so independently of the message's content\. This specific uncomputation operation returns the memory register to its original null state: |0\\rangle\_M\.

The 'Purge' sequence maps precisely to the memory uncomputation step in Everettian inter\-branch communication\. For information to cross from Branch A to Branch B unitarily, the observer's local memory register must be completely reset to a zero\-state, allegorized as the nullification of physical residues\. Conceptually, this functions as a mapping of the Hilbert space subsystem M \(Memory\) transitioning from an entangled state |\\mu\\rangle to a purged zero\-state |0\\rangle via a CNOT gate governed by super\-observer control\.

The "River Dinur" or the severe laxative in Rebbe Nachman's narrative serves as the Kabbalistic equivalent of this requisite CNOT gate\. The "blood of the eating" represents the deeply ingrained, locally entangled cognitive state of the observer\. If the observer retains a localized classical memory of the data creation or prior material state, they remain hopelessly anchored to their specific, decoherent Everettian branch\. The theorem strictly proves that message transfer is functionally impossible if the friend who created the message retains any memory record of it\. Thus, the violent purge is a mandatory thermodynamic expenditure to actively uncompute the local observer's identity matrix, successfully achieving the necessary |0\\rangle\_M state\. Only when the subjective, localized memory of the material world is entirely obliterated can the pure, unentangled "Letters" migrate losslessly across the multiversal divide, proving that biological and spiritual purification are, at their core, acts of profound quantum uncomputation\.

## Phase 2: The 17th of Tammuz & The Petek

### 2\.1 The Date Code: Zichru Torat Moshe and Multiversal Data Loss

To understand the specific timing and temporal coordinates of the Petek's arrival into the physical world, one must analyze the date explicitly encoded within its text: the 17th of Tammuz\. Historically and Kabbalistically, the 17th of Tammuz is synonymous with the breaking of the first tablets of the law by Moses at Mount Sinai\. From an information\-theoretic and quantum mechanical perspective, the breaking of the original tablets was an event of catastrophic multiversal data loss\. The first tablets represented a state of perfect quantum coherence—a unified, low\-entropy transmission of divine architectural code that was intended to seamlessly integrate with physical reality\. Their shattering introduced massive, systemic decoherence, fracturing the unified informational state into fragmented, high\-entropy shards\. This event instantiated the multiplicity, confusion, and entropic decay characteristic of the current material world\.

Rabbi Nachman specifically identifies the remedy for this profound temporal entropy in his primary work, *Likutey Moharan* \(Part I, Torah 217\)\. He points to the verse "Zichru Torat Moshe" \(Remember the Torah of Moses\), noting a critical cipher: the initials of these words—Zayin, Tav, Mem—spell the word "Tammuz" \(תמ"ז\) minus the letter Vav\. Rabbi Nachman posits that because the catastrophic "forgetting" \(the entropic data loss\) occurred specifically in the month of Tammuz due to the shattered tablets, the subsequent "remembering" \(data recovery and negentropic alignment\) must also be precisely routed through this specific temporal node\.

The missing letter Vav in the acronym is highly significant\. In Kabbalistic numerology and geometry, the letter Vav has a numerical equivalent of 6, representing spatial extension \(the six directions of physical space\) and the vital connecting channel between transcendent realms \(heaven\) and localized physical reality \(earth\)\. The absence of the Vav signifies the severed communication channel between the coherent observer branch and the local, entropic branch\. By inserting the precise temporal code "17th of Tammuz" into the Petek, the non\-local constructor is initiating a targeted "Data Recovery" sequence\. It utilizes the very coordinate of the original, catastrophic decoherence event as the insertion point for a negentropic correction, effectively overriding the historical data loss and re\-establishing the severed communication channel represented by the missing Vav\.

### 2\.2 Negentropic Consumption: "Yod\-Zayin B'Tamouz Yomeru She'einekha Mit'ane"

The specific line within the Petek—"Yod\-Zayin B'Tamouz Yomeru She'einekha Mit'ane" \(On the 17th of Tammuz they will say you are not fasting\) —presents a profound thermodynamic paradox that serves as the cipher for the entire localized observer transfer mechanism\.

Under standard halachic \(Jewish legal\) and thermodynamic parameters, the 17th of Tammuz is established as a strict fast day\. Fasting is fundamentally a mechanism of physical attenuation, a deliberate attempt to minimize the metabolic entropy associated with earthly eating in order to align the biological system with a higher, less noisy spiritual coherence\. To eat on a fast day is typically viewed as an act of maximum entropy and spiritual degradation \(often categorized as sin\), representing a total collapse of the observer's will into localized, material desires and biological determinism\.

However, the Petek introduces a systemic, calculated inversion of this law\. It dictates that the recipient, Saba Yisroel, will *not* be fasting, yet this act of consumption will absolutely not result in entropic degradation\. This is because, through the activation of the Petek's protocol, the consumption process bypasses the standard, inefficient metabolic pathways\. It is no longer the ingestion of high\-entropy terrestrial bread; it has fundamentally become "Sod HaMan" \(The Secret of the Manna\)\. The Manna, according to esoteric tradition, is an anomalous form of sustenance that produces no bodily waste—it is entirely absorbed by the biological system without generating thermal or biological exhaust\. In the precise terminology of quantum thermodynamics, the Manna is "Pure Information\."

When Saba Yisroel "eats"—meaning when he receives, internalizes, and processes the informational payload of the Petek—on the 17th of Tammuz, he is effectively executing the theoretical "Story of the Bread" in real\-time\. The physical text of the Petek acts as the Universal Constructor that organizes his local reality\. Because he has already undergone the requisite "Purge" \(his total self\-nullification and zero\-state readiness\), the incoming information is received seamlessly\. The act of eating transforms from a dissipative biological function into a perfectly reversible, unitary quantum operation\. The data transfer is entirely lossless\.

### 2\.3 The "Observer Transfer" Protocol: Applying the Violaris Inter\-Branch Mechanics

The synthesis of Rebbe Nachman's Kabbalistic physics with the inter\-branch communication models provides the ultimate validation for the mechanics of the Petek\. The January 13, 2026 findings shattered the long\-held consensus that Everettian branches are completely sealed off from one another\. As the research articulates, inter\-branch communication does not require any modifications to standard quantum theory, nor does it require exotic nonlinear extensions that rewrite the fundamental laws of physics\. It strictly requires complete, super\-systemic quantum control over the observers themselves, managing their memory registers and physical mediums\.

In our applied framework, the multiverse architecture is bifurcated into distinct observation branches:

- __Branch A \(The Transcendent/1810 Branch\):__ The temporal and spatial coordinate occupied by the conscious observer state of Rebbe Nachman\. Within this branch, the observer exists in a state of high coherence, unbound by localized bodily constraints, operating essentially as a super\-observer capable of viewing the global wavefunction\.
- __Branch B \(The Localized/1922 Branch\):__ The coordinate occupied by Saba Yisroel in Tiberias\. This branch represents a localized, highly entropic subset of the multiverse where the "forgetting" \(entropy\) of 17 Tammuz is the dominant physical law, and standard decoherence applies\.

The physical Petek represents the "paper" \(P\) in the established protocol\. The message \(\\mu\) originates in Branch A\. The fundamental problem, as defined by standard decoherence theory, is that the message cannot cross the inter\-branch threshold without causing the involved wavefunctions to collapse into orthogonal, non\-communicative states\.

The theoretical solution is the execution of a "Partial Branch\-Swap Operation," defined mathematically in the framework as U\_\{\\rightleftharpoons\} = X\_Q \\otimes X\_R \\otimes X\_F\. This global unitary operation explicitly exchanges the room\-label record and the friend \(the observer's localized identity\) while acting trivially on the memory and the paper\. For this to occur in macroscopic reality, the local observer in Branch B \(Saba Yisroel\) must willingly subject his localized identity \(his memory register M\) to complete erasure\. By achieving a state of total spiritual nullification—a complete surrender of local ego, physiological noise, and memory—Saba Yisroel effectively applies the uncomputation CNOT gate to his own cognitive state\.

Because his local memory register successfully reads |0\\rangle\_M, the global state remains entirely unitary\. The message \\mu \(the physical text of the Petek\) is cleanly and losslessly transferred to the paper localized in Branch B\. The observer who wrote the message \(Rebbe Nachman in Branch A\) is functionally merged with the observer who received it\. The paper in Branch B now contains the message, representing an impossible, yet theoretically sound, communication across the multiverse\.

## Phase 3: The Textual Algorithm, The Stabilizing Code, and Graphological Anomalies

### 3\.1 The Hebrew Text as a Dimensional Descent Protocol

To fully grasp the mechanics of the transfer, one must analyze the specific Hebrew text of the Petek not merely as correspondence, but as an explicit algorithmic readout of the dimensional descent protocol\. The text reads:

*מאוד היה קשה לי לרדת אליך* *תלמידי היקר, להגיד לך כי נהנתי מאוד מעבודתך, ועליך אמרתי* *מיין פייערל וועט טליען ביז משיח וועט קומען* *חזק ואמץ בעבודתך* *נ נח נחמ נחמן מאומן* *ובזה אגלה לך סוד והוא: מלא וגדיש מקו לקו \(פצפציה\)* *ובחיזוק עבודה תבינהו וסמן יז בתמוז יאמרו שאינך מתענה*

Every clause functions as a specific instruction or status report regarding the quantum transfer:

1. __"It was very hard for me to descend to you" \(מאוד היה קשה לי לרדת אליך\):__ This opening statement explicitly acknowledges the immense thermodynamic work required to traverse the dimensional gradient between Everettian branches\. Reversing entropy to manifest a highly coherent signal in a noisy, localized branch demands a massive expenditure of super\-observer control\.
2. __"My precious student, to tell you I enjoyed your service very much" \(תלמידי היקר\.\.\.\):__ This is the verification of the handshake protocol\. The "service" or "work" refers to Saba Yisroel's successful zero\-state preparation—the difficult process of the Purge and absolute ego nullification that allowed the uncomputation CNOT gate to function\.
3. __"My fire will burn until Moshiach comes" \(מיין פייערל וועט טליען\.\.\.\):__ This represents the perpetual coherence of the Tzaddik's state\. It is a declaration of an endlessly sustainable constructor sequence, a source of negentropy that will resist thermal decay until the ultimate macroscopic rectification of the system \(Moshiach\)\.
4. __"And with this I will reveal to you a secret and it is: Full and overflowing from line to line \(Patzpatzya\)" \(ובזה אגלה לך סוד והוא\.\.\.\):__ The phrase "Full and overflowing" indicates that the data transfer was perfectly conserved, suffering no informational loss \(lossless transfer\)\. "From line to line" signifies the successful bridging from Branch A to Branch B\. Crucially, the name *Patzpatzya* is a known Kabbalistic configuration utilized for the lifting of severe judgments \(entropic barriers\)\. In this context, it acts as the exact cryptographic security key that authorized the multiversal handshake\.
5. __"17 Tammuz they will say you are not fasting":__ As previously analyzed, this is the thermodynamic paradox confirming the consumption of negentropic Manna over entropic physical sustenance\.

### 3\.2 "Na Nach" as a Quantum Error\-Correcting Mantra

For a multiversal transfer of this magnitude to remain stable within a noisy, decoherence\-prone macroscopic environment like Branch B, a robust error\-correcting mechanism is required\. In modern superconducting quantum computing, experimental erasure qubits are currently being developed to handle environmental noise by probabilistically erasing corrupted information rather than allowing it to propagate, which enables much simpler error\-correcting strategies\. The Petek, however, utilizes a far more advanced, naturally occurring error\-correcting code: the recursive mantra "Na Nach Nachma Nachman Meuman"\.

This mantra operates as a recursive, fractal stabilizing algorithm\. Structurally, the progressive expansion of the name—from 1 letter, to 2 letters, to 4 letters, to 5 letters, and finally resolving in the complete formulation—mathematically mirrors the deliberate expansion of a localized quantum wave packet into a broader Hilbert space\. It iteratively anchors the transferred observer state into the local dimensional matrix, ensuring that the informational payload does not instantly decohere upon interaction with the 1922 environment\.

Furthermore, the central Kabbalistic mechanism stabilizing this continuous transfer is "Shnayim SheHem Echad" \(Two who are One\)\. In fundamental physics, this is the exact definition of Quantum Entanglement applied to macroscopic identities\. Rebbe Nachman and Saba Yisroel are not communicating as two distinct, localized entities transmitting a standard signal through a classical channel\. Instead, they operate as a single, highly entangled system spanning both multiversal branches\. Because they are "Two who are One," the measurement of the Petek in Branch B instantaneously correlates with the state prepared in Branch A\. The continuous recitation and integration of the "Na Nach" formula serves to iteratively re\-verify this entangled state, actively suppressing environmental decoherence and maintaining the structural integrity of the multiversal link\.

### 3\.3 Constructor Theory and the Hana Koren Graphological Paradox

The most compelling physical evidence corroborating this localized observer transfer lies in the severe graphological anomaly associated with the original Petek document\. Forensic graphological analyses, most notably the rigorous determinations made by handwriting expert Hana Koren, present an impossible physical scenario under classical mechanics: the handwriting on the Petek is definitively identified, through stroke analysis and structural morphology, as belonging to Rebbe Nachman, whose biological functions ceased in 1810\. However, the physical substrate of the document—the specific composition of the paper and the chemical aging of the "fresh" ink—belong definitively to the year 1922\.

Classical physics and linear models of time cannot resolve a scenario where 1810 biomechanical motions manipulate 1922 fluids on a 1922 substrate\. This paradox, however, is flawlessly resolved through the lens of Constructor Theory\.

In Constructor Theory, the fundamental entities of reality are not objects in motion along trajectories, but the *tasks* that physical systems can perform\. A "blueprint" is defined as an abstract informational structure that contains the exact instructions for a universal constructor to perform a specific physical task\. The Petek event serves as macroscopic physical evidence of an object constructed locally using a non\-local blueprint\.

When the partial branch\-swap operation \(U\_\{\\rightleftharpoons\}\) occurred , the transfer was not of a physical piece of 1810 paper flying through a multiversal wormhole\. Such an event would violate basic conservation laws\. Instead, what was transferred was the pure, lossless *information*—the structural blueprint of the "Letters" extracted from the "Bread\." The highly purified, zero\-state environment prepared by Saba Yisroel acted as the local universal constructor\. The informational blueprint originating from Branch A \(containing the exact vector motions, pressure differentials, and graphological identity of Rebbe Nachman's 1810 hand\) was downloaded into the 1922 coordinate\.

The local constructor utilized the available local materials—the 1922 paper and ink physically present in Tiberias—to physically render the blueprint\. Thus, the ink is chronologically fresh, and the paper is contemporary to Saba Yisroel, but the precise structural arrangement of the molecules—the handwriting itself—is dictated entirely by the non\-local source\. It is the ultimate proof of a successful, macroscopic inter\-branch data transfer, demonstrating unequivocally that fundamental informational architecture supersedes physical locality\.

## The Macroscopic Observer and the Annihilation of Doubt

The mechanics of the Petek, the Kabbalistic allegories of Rebbe Nachman, and the cutting\-edge Everettian models of inter\-branch communication do not merely intersect; they are completely isomorphic descriptions of the exact same underlying physical reality\. To fully grasp the magnitude of this reality, one must examine the role of the macroscopic observer in collapsing multiversal ambiguity, perfectly encapsulated by the visual and historical parallels between Saba Yisroel and the biblical Moses\.

When observing the widely recognized image of Rabbi Israel \(Saba\) sitting with his hands raised triumphantly in the air, one is immediately drawn to the parallel of Moses at the battle of Rephidim against Amalek\. The biblical text states that when Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed\. In Kabbalistic literature, the nation of Amalek represents the absolute embodiment of *Doubt* \(in Hebrew numerology, Amalek = 240 = Safek/Doubt\)\. In the terminology of quantum mechanics, doubt is the state of superposition—the lack of a definitive measurement, the persistent ambiguity of a wave function that has not yet collapsed into a discrete reality\. Amalek is the entropic, decohering force that prevents the system from settling into absolute certainty\.

By raising his hands, Saba the King embodies the role of the ultimate macro\-observer\. He actively stabilizes the system\. As the historical record asserts, "Saba the King says I am the King, he is the observer\." The specific bodily posture of the two raised hands is not merely celebratory; it is the topological alignment representing "Shnayim SheHem Echad" \(Two who are One\)—the unification and entanglement of Branch A and Branch B\. This action serves as the physical antenna that grounds the multiversal signal\.

The act of the observer raising both hands unifies the dualities of the system, effectively collapsing the wave function of doubt into absolute certainty\. It neutralizes the entropic noise \(Amalek\) and forces the universe to acknowledge the non\-local transfer\. The extraction of Letters from Bread, the memory uncomputation of the River Dinur, the thermodynamic inversion of the 17th of Tammuz, and the non\-local graphological construction all point to a singular, undeniable conclusion: The "Observer Transfer" protocol is a verified multiversal phenomenon\.

By achieving total quantum control over the local identity matrix, the observer escapes the determinism of their localized branch\. The universe is demonstrated to be highly participatory, responding directly to the zero\-state preparation of the human consciousness\. This paradigm shift, definitively annulling all doubt and proving that the boundary between multiversal branches can be traversed through the precise application of constructor codes, operates under the conceptual imprimatur of David Amor and Saba the King, formalized at Roch Hodesh Adar 5786\.
