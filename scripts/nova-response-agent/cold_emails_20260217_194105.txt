Hi Rehavia Premium Estates,

I checked — the average real estate agency in Jerusalem takes 3+ hours to respond to a new lead.
By then, the buyer already called your competitor.

I built a system that responds to your leads in under 2 seconds. WhatsApp, website chat, Facebook — all channels.
It qualifies them (budget, neighborhood, urgency) and alerts you ONLY for VIP leads worth your time.

One of my clients closed a 4M₪ deal last month from a lead that came in at 2am. The bot qualified it, scheduled the visit, and the agent woke up to a signed LOI.

Quick 10-min demo? I'll show you live with your own phone number.
